However, there is currently no known privilege on the object to obtain the Kerberos keys or to compromise the account in any other way. When you reset the password of krbtgt, AD will ignore your password input and use a random string instead. So, the reset password privilege does not work for a compromise. An attacker could use the reset password privilege to harm Tier Zero, as a double password reset causes all Kerberos TGTs in the domain to become invalid.

One option is to dump the private key of the CA and craft a ''golden certificate'' as a target user. This attack can be prevented by protecting the private key with hardware. Alternatively, the attacker can publish any template, modify pending certificate requests, and issue denied requests, which typically also enable a takeover of Tier Zero. Enterprise CA computer objects are therefore Tier Zero.\n\nIf the enterprise CA certificate is removed from the NTAuth store, then certificates from this CA cannot be used for domain authentication, thus preventing a Tier Zero takeover.'),

This is not enough to perform DCSync, where the GetChanges privilege is also required.\n\nThere are no known ways to abuse membership in this group to compromise Tier Zero.
