# AGENTS.md

## Golang code standards
- Golang code standards are enforced specifically for user or agent-written code, not code that is automatically generated by tooling (example: unit test mocks)
- Receiver functions on structs must use `s` as the variable name instead of the first letter of the struct type.
- Named returns are not allowed; all return variables must be defined in the function.
- Group variable initializations in a `var ( ... )` block and hoist them to the top of the function when possible.
- Use `any` instead of `interface{}`.
- Prefer rich variables names, for example: `databaseInterface` instead of `di` or `dbi`.

## PR instructions
- Title format: <conventional commit tag>: <Title> - <Jira tag>
- Always run `just prepare-for-codereview` before committing to perform tests and do code generation and license checks.

## Test code instructions for Golang
- If a test file is testing internal (non-exported) logic, the file may be included in the same package as the code being tested.
- If a test file is only testing the external (exported) pieces of code, the file should use the same package as the code being tested with `_test` appended.
  - Example: `auth.go` has `package api`, `auth_test.go` is only testing exported logic in `auth.go` and should have `package api_test`
- Integration tests should be separated from unit tests, such that if we have an `auth.go` file, `auth_test.go` should have unit tests and `auth_integration_test.go` should have integration tests.
- Integration test files should have a `serial_integration` build tag at the top of the file, underneath the license header: `//go:build serial_integration`

## Code review instructions
- Code files must have a license header at the top of the file using a code comment block. The file `LICENSE.header` file has an up-to-date version of the header.
- The file located at `cmd/api/src/database/db.go` contains a Database interface type. This interface must be implemented by the `MockDatabase` struct in `cmd/api/src/database/mocks/db.go` and is generated by `go.uber.org/mock/mockgen`. If it is not fully implemented, that means the command `just prepare-for-codereview` was not run before commiting the code.
