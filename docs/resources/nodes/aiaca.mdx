## Representation

The AIACA node represents the Active Directory LDAP objects of the _certificationAuthority_ class located in the _AIA_ container in the Configuration Naming Context.

## Node properties

The node supports the properties of the table. Three types of property names will be used, depending on where the property is found:

* **Entity Panel:** Name shown in the BloodHound UI.
* **Database:** Name stored in the BloodHound database and returned by the BloodHound API. This is to be used when running Cypher queries.
* **Directory:** Name collected from the directory the node is stored in, for example, the LDAP name for an Active Directory property.

|     |     |     |     |

| Object ID | objectid | objectGUID | The object's unique identifier in the directory. |
| ACL Inheritance Denied | isaclprotected | nTSecurityDescriptor | Whether inherited permissions (ACEs) from containers are blocked on this object. |
| Basic Constraint Path Length | basicconstraintpathlength | caCertificate (X509Certificate) | The maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may follow this certificate in a valid certificate chain. |
| Certificate Chain | certchain | caCertificate (X509Certificate) | A hierarchical list of certificates starting with the certificate for this CA and ending with a self-signed root certificate. Each certificate is signed by the private key of the next CA certificate. |

| Created | whencreated | whenCreated | When the object was created in the directory. |
| Distinguished Name | distinguishedname | distinguishedName | The name of the object and it's location in AD. |

| Domain SID | domainsid | -   | The SID of the domain the object belongs to. |
| Has Basic Constraints | hasbasicconstraints | caCertificate (X509Certificate) | Whether the CA certificate has basic constraints. |
| Has Cross Certificate Pair | hascrosscertificatepair | crossCertificatePair | Whether the CA has trust to any external certificate. |
| Last Collected by BloodHound | lastseen | -   | When the object was last collected and ingested in BloodHound. |
| -   | crosscertificatepair | crossCertificatePair | List of external certificates trusted by the CA. |
| -   | name | name + domain name | Name of the object + @ + the name of the domain. |
