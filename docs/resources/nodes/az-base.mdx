This article outlines the AZBase node in BloodHound, it describes the node's properties and possible incoming/outgoing edges.

## Representation

The AZBase node is the basis for all other "AZ" Entra ID/Azure nodes and is used when a node type is unknown, for example, after an object is deleted. The node is retained as it may have edges linked to/from it.

## Node properties

The node supports the properties of the table. Three types of property names will be used, depending on where the property is found:

* **Entity Panel:** Name shown in the BloodHound UI.
* **Database:** Name stored in the BloodHound database and returned by the BloodHound API. This is to be used when running Cypher queries.
* **Directory:** Name collected from the directory the node is stored in, for example, the LDAP name for an Active Directory property.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Entity Panel** | **Database** | **Directory** | **Description** |
| Object ID | objectid | -   | The object's unique identifier in the directory. |
| Last Seen by BloodHound | lastseen | -   | When the object was last collected and ingested in BloodHound. |
| -   | name | -   | Object ID of the object. |

## Edges

Any edge type may be linked to/from this node. See the [edges documentation](/resources/edges) for more information on the edge types.
