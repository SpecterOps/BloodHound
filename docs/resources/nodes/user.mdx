| ACL Inheritance Denied | Identifies whether an object is allowing ACL inheritance to itself. |
| Admin Count | Whether the object currently, or possibly ever has belonged to a certain set of highly privileged groups. For Active Directory nodes this is related to the AdminSDHolder object and the SDProp process. Read more about that [here.](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2053) |
| Admin Rights Count | The number of computers that the object has been added to the local administrators group on. |
| Allows Unconstrained Delegation | Whether the object is allowed to perform unconstrained kerberos delegation. See more info about that [here](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/another-word-on-delegation/). |

| Pwdneverexpires | Whether the UAC flag is set to not require the object to update its password. |
| Sensitive | Whether the UAC flag is to disallow Kerberos delegation for this object. If this is “True”, then the object cannot be abused as part of a Kerberos delegation attack. |
