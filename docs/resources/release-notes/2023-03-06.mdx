## BloodHound Release Notes - March 6, 2023

### BloodHound Enterprise

### New Features

- **Enhanced Performance**: Improved database query optimization and caching
- **UI Improvements**: Better visualization of attack paths and relationships
- **Cross-Trust Collection**: Added support for cross-trust collection. See [SharpHound Cross-Trust Collection](/install-data-collector/install-sharphound/cross-trust-collection) documentation for more.

For instructions on upgrading your collector, see [Install and Upgrade SharpHound Enterprise](/install-data-collector/install-sharphound/install-upgrade).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed several issues with SAML authentication
- Improved error handling for API requests
- Resolved UI rendering inconsistencies

### SharpHound Enterprise (v2.1.2)

_Minimum version of SharpHound Service to support all current functionality: v2.1.2_

### Improved Functionality

* **Optional support for LDAP authentication auto-negotiation (simplified External trust collection support)** \- SharpHound now supports a configurable option to enable authentication auto-negotiation for LDAP authentication (ForceLDAPkerberosAuth, defaulted to True). In most cases, the default value is preferred.

    By default, your forest will not attempt to search for principals across External trusts without a specific configuration to do so. If you are unable to configure the Forest Search Order to do so, auto-negotiation will allow NTLM authentication to the trusted domains (mimicking the behavior of the SharpHound open-source collector). See [SharpHound Cross-Trust Collection](/install-data-collector/install-sharphound/cross-trust-collection) documentation for more.


* **Maximum concurrent search query support** \- SharpHound now supports a configurable number of maximum concurrent queries executed against a domain controller (MaxConcurrentSearchQueries, defaulted to 15). Historically, SharpHound would attempt queries as quickly as possible; however, this could exceed the maximum allowable queries configured. In most cases, the default value should be sufficient.

### Bug Fixes

* In specific cases, collections showed AD groups belonging to local groups where this was not the case. This has been resolved.
* Improved logging for specific issues

**NOTE:** Upgrading to SharpHound v2+ must occur concurrently on all services and requires enabling the "User Rights Assignment Collection" experimental feature at the same time. Please contact your TAM or respond to this email for assistance.
