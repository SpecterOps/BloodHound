### BloodHound Enterprise

#### Improved Functionality

* **Improved Inbound/Outbound Object Control Performance -** The logic for entity panels' Inbound and Outbound Object Control sections has been completely rewritten for improved speed and performance.

#### Bug Fixes

* Alongside the performance improvements, Inbound and Outbound Object Control sections are now more accurate for which objects are included in the result sets.
* GetChangesInFilteredSet is not an exploitable escalation path on its own and has been excluded from Pathfinding queries. This edge is automatically considered where appropriate for the DCSync edge alongside GetChanges and GetChangesAll.

#### Improved Functionality
