### BloodHound (v5.14.0)

#### New and Improved Features

* **New Attack Paths: Entra-AD User Syncing** \- Introduced to the BloodHound graph in April 2022 as a fully supported feature, Entra has remained a dissociated data set from AD. Ever since we've wanted to connect the graphs to show risk across those connection points. In this release, we're adding coverage of user synchronization - showing where Entra and AD users are synced to each other across those environments. This release will enable users to identify and validate paths across those links via pathfinding and cypher. With this work complete, we're starting a project in BloodHound Enterprise to measure the cross-platform risk from these paths!

#### Bug Fixes
