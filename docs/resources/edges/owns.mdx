AZOwns targets resources in Entra ID (for example [AZGroup](/resources/nodes/az-group), [AZServicePrincipal](/resources/nodes/az-service-principal), and [AZDevice](/resources/nodes/az-device)) from various object-specific ownership.

<Info>
  **Note: The edges [AZOwner](/resources/edges/owner) and [AZOwns](/resources/edges/owns) are distinct as they each apply their own distinct identity and access management platform (AzureRM and Entra ID respectively) with distinct mechanics, abuse primitives, and remediation steps.**
</Info>

## Abuse Info

Object ownership means almost all abuses are possible against the target object.

## Opsec Considerations
This depends on which abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log for each abuse action.
