## Abuse Info

The PowerShell script Invoke-DCOM implements lateral movement using a variety of different COM objects (ProgIds: MMC20.Application, ShellWindows, ShellBrowserWindow, ShellBrowserWindow, and ExcelDDE). LethalHTA implements lateral movement using the HTA COM object (ProgId: htafile).

One can manually instantiate and manipulate COM objects on a remote machine using the following PowerShell code. If specifying a COM object by its CLSID:

```bash
$ComputerName = <target computer name>              # Remote computer
$clsid = "{fbae34e8-bf95-4da8-bf98-6c6e580aa348}"   # GUID of the COM object
$Type = [Type]::GetTypeFromCLSID($clsid, $ComputerName)
$ComObject = [Activator]::CreateInstance($Type)
```

If specifying a COM object by its ProgID:

```bash
$ComputerName = <target computer name>              # Remote computer
$ProgId = "<NAME>"                                  # GUID of the COM object
$Type = [Type]::GetTypeFromProgID($ProgId, $ComputerName)
$ComObject = [Activator]::CreateInstance($Type)
```

## Opsec Considerations
The artifacts generated when using DCOM vary depending on the specific COM object used.

DCOM is built on top of the TCP/IP RPC protocol (TCP ports 135 + high ephemeral ports) and may leverage several different RPC interface UUIDs(outlined here). In order to use DCOM, one must be authenticated. Consequently, logon events and authentication-specific logs(Kerberos, NTLM, etc.) will be generated when using DCOM.

Processes may be spawned as the user authenticating to the remote system, as a user already logged into the system, or may take advantage of an already spawned process.

Many DCOM servers spawn under the process “svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch” and typically have a command line containing the string ” -Embedding” or are executing inside of the DLL hosting process “DllHost.exe /Processid:\{&lt;AppId&gt;}” (where AppId is the AppId the COM object is registered to use). Certain COM services are implemented as service executables; consequently, service-related event logs may be generated.
