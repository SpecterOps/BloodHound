A principal with this signifies the capability of retrieving, through a directory synchronization, the value of confidential and RODC filtered attributes, such as LAPS’ _ms-Mcs-AdmPwd_.

Abuse Info
----------

To abuse these privileges, use DirSync:

Sync-LAPS -LDAPFilter '(samaccountname=TargetComputer$)'

For other optional parameters, view the DirSync documentation.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

Executing the attack will generate a 4662 (An operation was performed on an object) event at the domain controller if an appropriate SACL is in place on the target object.
