## Abuse Info

When a principal has such a role scoped to the tenant, they gain control of all app registrations and service principals in the tenant. If a principal has the same role scoped to individual objects, they only gain control of those particular objects. This is unique to just a handful of roles, but custom roles can also work this way.

## Opsec Considerations

This will depend on which particular abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log event for each abuse.
