 By default, administrators have several ways to perform remote code execution on Windows systems, including via RDP, WMI, WinRM, the Service Control Manager, and remote DCOM execution.

Further, administrators have several options for impersonating other users logged onto the system, including plaintext password extraction, token impersonation, and injecting into processes running as another user.

Finally, administrators can often disable host-based security controls that would otherwise prevent the aforementioned techniques.

## Abuse Info

There are several ways to pivot to a Windows system. If using Cobalt Strike’s beacon, check the help info for the commands “psexec”, “psexec_psh”, “wmi”, and “winrm”. With Empire, consider the modules for Invoke-PsExec, Invoke-DCOM, and Invoke-SMBExec.

With Metasploit, consider the modules “exploit/windows/smb/psexec”, “exploit/windows/winrm/winrm\_script\_exec”, and “exploit/windows/local/ps\_wmi\_exec”.

Additionally, there are several manual methods for remotely executing code on the machine, including via RDP, with the service control binary and interaction with the remote machine’s service control manager, and remotely instantiating DCOM objects. For more information about these lateral movement techniques, see the References section below.

### Gathering credentials

The most well-known tool for gathering credentials from a Windows system is mimikatz. mimikatz is built into several agents and toolsets, including Cobalt Strike’s beacon, Empire, and Meterpreter. While running in a high integrity process with SeDebugPrivilege, execute one or more of mimikatz’s credential gathering techniques (e.g.: sekurlsa::wdigest, sekurlsa::logonpasswords, etc.), then parse or investigate the output to find clear-text credentials for other users logged onto the system.

You may also gather credentials when a user types them or copies them to their clipboard! Several keylogging capabilities exist, several agents and toolsets have them built-in. For instance, you may use meterpreter’s “keyscan\_start” command to start keylogging a user, then “keyscan\_dump” to return the captured keystrokes. Or, you may use PowerSploit’s Invoke-ClipboardMonitor to periodically gather the contents of the user’s clipboard.

### Token Impersonation

You may run into a situation where a user is logged onto the system, but you can’t gather that user’s credential. This may be caused by a host-based security product, lsass protection, etc. In those circumstances, you may abuse Windows’ token model in several ways. First, you may inject your agent into that user’s process, which will give you a process token as that user, which you can then use to authenticate to other systems on the network. Or, you may steal a process token from a remote process and start a thread in your agent’s process with that user’s token. For more information about token abuses, see the References tab.

### Disabling host-based security controls

Several host-based controls may affect your ability to execute certain techniques, such as credential theft, process injection, command line execution, and writing files to disk. Administrators can often disable these host-based controls in various ways, such as stopping or otherwise disabling a service, unloading a driver, or making registry key changes. For more information, see the References section below.

## Opsec Considerations

There are several forensic artifacts generated by the techniques described above. For instance, lateral movement via PsExec will generate 4697 events on the target system. If the target organization is collecting and analyzing those events, they may very easily detect lateral movement via PsExec.

Additionally, an EDR product may detect your attempt to inject into lsass and alert a SOC analyst. There are many more opsec considerations to keep in mind when abusing administrator privileges. For more information, see the References section below.
