The edge indicates that an IssuancePolicy has an OID group link to a group.

Certificate templates may include the IssuancePolicy as an issuance policy extension. Users authenticating using a certificate of such a certificate template will be granted access as a member of the group.

Abuse Info[](#h_01HZ7C2A3P68728AS1KESC5R59)
-------------------------------------------

An attacker may perform the ADCS ESC13 abuse which relies on the OID group link. This relationship alone is not enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals.

Opsec Considerations[](#h_01HZ7C2A3PBG7CXN767B2E029D)
-----------------------------------------------------

When an attacker abuses a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on this relationship, it will necessarily result in the issuance of a certificate. A copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
