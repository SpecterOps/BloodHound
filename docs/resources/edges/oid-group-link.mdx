The edge indicates that an IssuancePolicy has an OID group link to a group.

Certificate templates may include the IssuancePolicy as an issuance policy extension. Users authenticating using a certificate of such a certificate template will be granted access as a member of the group.

Abuse Info
-----------

An attacker may perform the ADCS ESC13 abuse which relies on the OID group link. This relationship alone is not enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals.

Opsec Considerations
---------------------

When an attacker abuses a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on this relationship, it will necessarily result in the issuance of a certificate. A copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
