The given source principal has, in its SIDHistory attribute, the SID for the target principal.

When a Kerberos ticket is created for source principal, it will include the SID for the target principal, and therefore grant the source principal the same privileges and permissions as the target principal.

Abuse Info
-----------

No special actions are needed to abuse this, as the Kerberos tickets created will have all SIDs in the object’s SID history attribute added to them; however, if traversing a domain trust boundary, ensure that SID filtering is not enforced, as SID filtering will ignore any SIDs in the SID history portion of a Kerberos ticket.

By default, SID filtering is not enabled for all domain trust types.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

No opsec considerations apply to this edge.
