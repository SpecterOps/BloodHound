## Abuse Info

To abuse this privilege, use Whisker:

```bash
Whisker.exe add /target:<TargetPrincipal>
```

For other optional parameters, view the Whisker documentation.

## Opsec Considerations

Executing the attack will generate a 5136 (A directory object was modified) event at the domain controller if an appropriate SACL is in place on the target object.

If PKINIT is not common in the environment, a 4768 (Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested) ticket can also expose the attacker.
