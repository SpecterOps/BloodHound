The system-assigned identity for the AKS Cluster will have the Contributor role against the target Resource Group and its child Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

## Abuse Info

You will abuse this relationship by executing a command against the AKS Managed Cluster the edge is emitting from. You can target any managed identity assignment scoped to the Virtual Machine Scale Sets under the target Resource Group.

## Opsec Considerations

This will depend on which particular abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log event for each abuse.
