The Entra user is synchronized to the on-prem AD user.

The Entra user may be able to authenticate as the on-prem AD user with its own password if password write-back is enabled. The Entra user may already have the same password as the on-prem user if password hash synchronization is enabled.

Abuse Info
----------

An attacker may authenticate as the on-prem AD user using the Entra user’s credentials, for example by key-logging the user’s password, or by changing the Entra user’s password and waiting for the password write-back operation to complete.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

The attacker may create artifacts of abusing this relationship in both on-prem AD and in Entra. A password write-back operation against the on-prem user may create a 4724 Windows event, along with a corresponding Entra activity log entry indicating the Entra user’s password was changed.
