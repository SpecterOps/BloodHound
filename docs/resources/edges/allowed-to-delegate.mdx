title: AllowedToDelegate
description: "The constrained delegation primitive allows a principal to authenticate as any user to specific services (found in the msds-AllowedToDelegateTo LDAP property in the source node tab) on the target computer."

That is, a node with this privilege can impersonate any domain principal (including Domain Admins) to the specific service on the target host. One caveat- impersonated users can not be in the “Protected Users” security group or otherwise have delegation privileges revoked.

An issue exists in the constrained delegation where the service name (sname) of the resulting ticket is not a part of the protected ticket information, meaning that an attacker can modify the target service name to any service of their choice. For example, if msds-AllowedToDelegateTo is “HTTP/host.domain.com”, tickets can be modified for LDAP/HOST/etc. service names, resulting in complete server compromise, regardless of the specific service listed.

## Abuse Info

Abusing this privilege can utilize Benjamin Delpy’s Kekeo project, proxying in traffic generated from the Impacket library, or using the Rubeus project’s s4u abuse.

In the following example, _victim_ is the attacker-controlled account (i.e. the hash is known) that is configured for constrained delegation. That is, _victim_ has the “HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local” service principal name (SPN) set in its msds-AllowedToDelegateTo property. The command first requests a TGT for the _victim_ user and executes the S4U2self/S4U2proxy process to impersonate the “admin” user to the “HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local” SPN. The alternative sname “cifs” is substituted in to the final service ticket and the ticket is submitted to the current logon session. This grants the attacker the ability to access the file system of PRIMARY.testlab.local as the “admin” user.

```bash
Rubeus.exe s4u /user:victim /rc4:2b576acbe6bcfda7294d6bd18041b8fe /impersonateuser:admin /msdsspn:"HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local" /altservice:cifs /ptt
```

## Opsec Considerations

As mentioned in the abuse info, in order to currently abuse this primitive the Rubeus C# assembly needs to be executed on some system with the ability to send/receive traffic in the domain. See the References for more information.
