This article explains the multiple tenant-wide configurations supported by BloodHound Enterprise. The configurations can be changed by a BloodHound Administrator in ⚙️ > Administration > BloodHound Configuration.

## Reconciliation Configuration


When enabled, BloodHound Enterprise will perform data reconciliation and retention. The configuration also allows for the changing of the default retention time. See [Data reconciliation and retention](/collect-data/enterprise-collection/data-retention).

## Citrix RDP Support

When enabled, BloodHound Enterprise will prevent false-positive CanRDP findings for Citrix VDAs.

This configuration adds to the [CanRDP edge conditions](/resources/edges/can-rdp) that a non-administrative principal must also be a member of the computer's local "Direct Access Users" group, which Citrix created to allow non-brokered access to VDAs.
