| 4GB of RAM     | 96GB of RAM                    |
| 4 processor cores     | 12 processor cores                    |
| 10GB hard disk space   | 50GB hard disk space           |

<Warning>BloodHound Community Edition is a security auditing tool that was written to test the resilience of networks against attackers. Because this tool can equally be used for evil, some anti-malware and EDR solutions flag BloodHound and its components as **malware**. If you encounter issues with downloads being blocked and files being prohibited from execution, you may have to shut off these protections. We recommend that you set up BloodHound on a dedicated machine so that your regular work environment remains protected. If you are planning to use BloodHound on a corporate network, please notify your Security Operations Center (SOC) ahead of time and ensure you have the required permissions to audit the network. For legal and ethical reasons, you must never use BloodHound on systems you do not own or lack explicit permission to audit. </Warning>

# Install BloodHound CE

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started). This gives you access to Docker Compose.

2.	Download the latest release of **[Bloodhound CLI](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases)** for your operating system and architecture (AMD or ARM) and unpack the file. BloodHound CLI is a utility that makes it easy to install BloodHound Community Edition in containers on your machine. To avoid the software getting blocked as malware in the browser, we recommend downloading it via command line using the following commands ([substitute your architecture as appropriate](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases/latest)):

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Linux
    wget https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases/latest/download/bloodhound-cli-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

    ``` powershell Windows PowerShell
    curl.exe -L -o "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\bloodhound-cli-windows-amd64.zip" https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases/latest/download/bloodhound-cli-windows-amd64.zip
    ```

    ```bash Mac
    curl -L -o bloodhound-cli-darwin-arm64.tar.gz https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases/latest/download/bloodhound-cli-darwin-arm64.tar.gz

    If you lose the password, you can reset it locally using BloodHound CLI:

    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Linux
        ./bloodhound-cli resetpwd
        ```

        ``` powershell Windows PowerShell
        .\bloodhound-cli resetpwd
        ```

        ```bash Mac
        ./bloodhound-cli resetpwd
        ```
      </CodeGroup>


6. Go to [http://localhost:8080/ui/login](http://localhost:8080/ui/login), and log in with `admin` and the randomly generated password from the last installation step.

    <Note>
      The default `docker-compose.yml` example binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1). To access BloodHound outside of localhost, follow the instructions in [examples/docker-compose/README.md](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/blob/main/examples/docker-compose/README.md) to configure host binding for the container.
    </Note>

7. Reset the password as prompted.

You're now logged in to a locally hosted BloodHound CE tenant running with Docker Compose.

# Get data into BloodHound

To get data into BloodHound, ingest sample data or run a data collector.

## Option 1: Ingest sample data

Sample collection data helps you explore and test BloodHound CE functionality before using your own data.

To ingest the BloodHound sample data:

1. Download sample data for [Active Directory](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17799530/ad_example_data.zip) or [Azure](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17799516/azurehound_example.zip)

    Active Directory Sample Data generated with SharpHound includes:
    * 3 collected domains with trusts between them
    * Additional, visible, trusted domains without collections
    * Coverage for local permissions
    * Multiple ADCS escalation paths

    Azure Sample Data generated with AzureHound includes:
    * Full collection of an Azure environment
    * Support for user-sync hybrid paths when ingested alongside the example AD data


2. From the BloodHound CE UI, go to settings (⚙️) → **Administration** → **Upload Files**.

  <Note> The default admin email address is spam@example.com. You may notice this show up as the user who's ingesting the data.</Note>

## Option 2: Ingest your data with data collectors

BloodHound CE analyzes data collected by its two collector services, each collecting from a specific directory:
* Active Directory, collected by SharpHound CE
* Entra ID and Azure, collected by AzureHound CE

### Download collectors

Each collector is a standalone binary. Download collectors using one of these methods:
* From BloodHound CE, click ⚙️ → **Download Collectors** → the download button for **SHARPHOUND** or **AZUREHOUND**.
* Download the collector from their respective GitHub repository: [SharpHound repository](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound/releases) or [AzureHound repository](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/AzureHound/releases).
* Build the collector from source with the source code for [SharpHound](/collect-data/ce-collection/sharphound) or [AzureHound](/collect-data/ce-collection/azurehound).

### Run a collector
Run the SharpHound or AzureHound collector. During collection, JSON files are generated and compressed into a ZIP file.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Run SharpHound from a domain-joined Windows system
# Run SharpHound CE
C:\> SharpHound.exe
```

```bash Run AzureHound
# Run AzureHound CE
C:\> AzureHound.exe --username "MattNelson@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" --password "MyVeryStrongPassword" --tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" list
```
</CodeGroup>
For Azure argument definitions, see [All AzureHound Community Edition Flags, Explained](/collect-data/ce-collection/azurehound-flags).

### Ingest data into BloodHound

Use the BloodHound CE API or the BloodHound CE UI to ingest collected data into BloodHound.

To ingest collected data with the API, use the BloodHound CE endpoint `/api/v2/file-upload/`. See the [BloodHound API documentation](/integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api) for details.

To ingest collected data with the BloodHound CE UI, go to settings (⚙️) → **Administration → Data Collection →** select **File Ingest →** click **UPLOAD FILES** and upload your files.

BloodHound CE accepts .zip archives or JSON files, with no size limit. Your browser's ability to package the uploaded file is a limiting factor in uploading large datasets directly through the UI.

# Explore attack paths

To look at identified attack paths in the graph, go to the **Explore** page in the BloodHound CE UI.

<Steps>
 <Step title="Search for a user">
   1. In the **Search** bar, search nodes for a user like `user:bob`.
   2. Select the user and click on the node that appears.
   3. Explore information about the user's sessions and memberships.
 </Step>

 <Step title="Pathfind">
   Review the path from one user to another on the **Pathfinding** tab. For example, pathfind from `BOB` to `ADMINISTRATOR`.
 </Step>

 <Step title="Explore Cypher queries">
   Explore the pre-saved Cypher queries on the **Cypher** tab.
 </Step>
</Steps>
