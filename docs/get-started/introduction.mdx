BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal hidden and often unintended relationships within Active Directory, Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and Microsoft Azure IaaS. Defenders (blue teams) and attackers (red teams) use BloodHound for a deeper understanding of privileged relationships in an environment.

There are two BloodHound products: BloodHound Enterprise and BloodHound Community Edition (BloodHound CE). This site documents both products.
