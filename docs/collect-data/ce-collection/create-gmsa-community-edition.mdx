This page describes how to configure and run the SharpHound Community Edition collection tool using an Active Directory gMSA. 

<MySnippet word="Community Edition"/>

## Configure User Rights

As Sharphound is launched with a PowerShell script instead of running as a service, you need to grant the gMSA account the **Log on as a batch job** User Right instead of the **Log on as Service** User Right. Do this with the Local Security Policy or Group Policy.

### Configure user permissions

The Active Directory details collected by SharpHound depend on the permissions that the user running SharpHound has within the Domain.
A regular, non-privileged user can run Shaprhound and collect a significant amount of information, but some of the Edges can only be collected by users with elevated permissions within the Domain.

At this time there are two main paths that could give the SharpHound gMSA account the permissions needed to collect the required Active Directory information:

- **Method 1**: Make the SharpHound gMSA account a member of the Local Administrators group on all computers in the domain.
- **Method 2**: Make the SharpHound gMSA account a member of the Domain Admins group.

Using an account that has Domain Admins permissions enables the SharpHound executable to collect all of the possible pertinent information from Active Directory for the best possible analysis by BloodHound. 

#### Implement gMSA account protections
Regardless of whether the permissions that are given to the SharpHound gMSA account are using Method 1 or Method 2, consider additional protections.

See [SharpHound Enterprise Service Hardening](/manage-bloodhound/securing-bloodhound-and-collectors/sharphound-hardening.mdx) to learn about protections you can implement to prevent the SharpHound gMSA account from being compromised and leveraged by an attacker. 

The gMSA account should be a member of the Active Directory **Protected Users** group.
[Tiering the Sharphound gMSA account access](install-data-collector/install-sharphound/tiered-collector-strategy) is another methodology you can implement.

#### Configure the gMSA account as a Domain Admin 

Add the gMSA account to the **Domain Admins** group. 

<Note>The account has a `$` at the end of it. Enter the account in this format when adding it to the **Domain Admins** group.</Note>

You should also add the gMSA account to the **Protected Users** group. If you're not familiar with the Active Directory **Protected Users** groups, refer to the [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/protected-users-security-group). There are a number of benefits to using this group to protect privileged accounts from being vulnerable to NTLM Relay attacks and other credential attacks.

## Create a SharpHound PowerShell script to run as a scheduled task

Create a PowerShell script to run SharpHound with a scheduled task. 

### Create a script

To create the script: 

1. Create a directory named `Sharphound` in the `C:\Support` directory.
2. Create a sub-directory named `Results` in the `C:\Support\Sharphound` directory.
3. Copy the Sharphound executable to the `C:\Support\Sharphound` directory on the server where the scheduled task runs (the Sharphound executable should be zipped in a password protected zip file so that it doesn't get prevented by Microsoft Defender during the file transfer).

    The PowerShell script contains:

    - The full path to the SharpHound executable
    - The command line arguments that you want to pass to SharpHound
    - Redirection of the output to a log file 
    - Deletion of files in the `C:\Support\Sharphound\Results` directory that are older than 2 months

```
$FileDateStamp = Get-Date -Format FileDateTime  
C:\Support\SharpHound\SharpHound.exe -c all --outputdirectory C:\Support\SharpHound\Results\ --zipfilename <DomainName>_BloodHound_gmsa.zip *> "C:\Support\SharpHound\Results\$FileDateStamp-<DomainName>_sharphound-gmsa.log"  
  
$Folder = "C:\Support\Sharphound\Results"  
  
#Delete files older than 2 months  
Get-ChildItem $Folder -Recurse -Force -ea 0 |  
? {!$_.PsIsContainer -and $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-60)} |  
ForEach-Object {  
   $_ | del -Force  
   $_.FullName | Out-File "C:\Support\Sharphound\$FileDateStamp-deletedlog.txt"  
   }  
```

4. Save the PowerShell script named `Sharphound_Collection.ps1` to the `C:\Support\Sharphound` directory.

5. Modify the names of the base --zipfilename and the log file for each specific domain where this is deployed.


The resulting directory structure should resemble: 
    <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-directory-structure.png" alt=""/>
    </Frame> 

The resulting `SharpHound_Collection.ps1` PowerShell script should resemble:

    <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-powershell-script.png" alt=""/>
    </Frame> 

### Create a scheduled task

To create the scheduled task, choose the PowerShell method or the GUI method. The PowerShell method is the easiest way to create the scheduled task.

To create the scheduled task with PowerShell:

1. Run these PowerShell commands, modifying files names and domain names as necessary:

    ```
    $arg = "-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -NoProfile -File C:\Support\SharpHound\Sharphound_Collection.ps1"  
    $ta = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe  -Argument $arg  
    $tt = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -At 9:00 -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday  
    $ap = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserID 2022TESTING\t0_gMSA_SHS$ -LogonType Password   
    Register-ScheduledTask SharpHoundCollection –Action $ta –Trigger $tt –Principal $ap  
    ```
2. Construct the PowerShell commands needed for your environment in preparation for executing them in an elevated PowerShell shell.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-powershell-env-commands.png" alt=""/>
    </Frame> 

3. Copy and paste the PowerShell commands into the elevated PowerShell shell to create the scheduled task.
4. After refreshing the Scheduled Tasks MMC, you should see the newly created scheduled task that runs as the gMSA account.

 <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-powershell-created-task.png" alt=""/>
 </Frame> 

To create the scheduled task with the GUI:

1. Open the Scheduled Tasks MSC on the SharpHound server and create a scheduled task. In the example shown below, the scheduled task name is SharpHound.

     <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-gui-created-task.png" alt=""/>
    </Frame> 

2. Configure the scheduled task to run on the desired schedule.
3. Configure the scheduled task with this **Action**: 

    -  **Program / script**: `powershell.exe`
    - **Arguments**: `-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File C:\Support\SharpHound.ps1`

4. Click **OK** on the **Edit Action**.
5. Configure the scheduled task to run as a standard user account at this time.
6. Click **OK** on the scheduled task to complete the creation.
7. Provide the password for the standard user account when prompted and click **OK**.

You should now have a scheduled task to run SharpHound created. 

### Modify the scheduled task to run as the gMSA account

At this point you should see the scheduled task setup to run using the user account you previously configured.

     <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/sharphound-gmsa-gui-task-setup.png" alt=""/>
    </Frame> 

Run this following command to modify the scheduled task to run as the gMSA account: 

```
schtasks /change /TN \SharpHound /RU 2022TESTING\t0_gMSA_SHS$ /RP 
```

An alternate PowerShell method of modifying the scheduled task to run as the gMSA account: 

```
New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -Id SharpHound -UserID Domain\GMServiceAccount$ -LogonType Password -RunLevel Highest  
```

You should see a message stating that command was successful.

If you open the scheduled task you should see that the account it will run as is the gMSA account.

### Test the SharpHound scheduled task

To test the scheduled task running as the gMSA account, right click on the scheduled task and click **Run**.

When completed, a zip file should appear with the results.
