## 3.1 - ACCESS CONTROL


### 3.1.1

#### Basic Requirement

Limit system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, and
devices (including other systems).

**3.1.1 Discussion**

Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography)
control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users)
and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. Access
enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide
increased information security. Other systems include systems internal and external to the
organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The
definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account
type (e.g., privileged verses non-privileged) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access levels and validate access permissions.

### 3.1.2

#### Basic Requirement

Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are
permitted to execute.

**3.1.2 Discussion**

Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of
account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group, system,
anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary. Other attributes
required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-
origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission or business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements).

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access levels and validate access permissions.

### 3.1.5

#### Basic Requirement

Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged
accounts.

**3.1.5 Discussion**

Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized accesses for
users and processes. The principle of least privilege is applied with the goal of authorized privileges
no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions.
Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as
necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development,
implementation, and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing
system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges).
Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator
for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to
specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information
or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this requirement between
allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the
ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to
sufficiently mitigate risk.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise audits and reports the health of organizational privilege access models and identifies potential vulnerable attack paths and misconfigurations within the privilege access architecture scheme.

### 3.1.6
#### Basic Requirement

Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non-security functions.

**3.1.6 Discussion**

This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The
inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such
as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in
the change of access authorizations for the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as
would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise audits and reports the health of organizational privilege access models and identifies potential vulnerable attack paths and misconfigurations within the privilege access architecture scheme.

### 3.1.7

#### Basic Requirement

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of
such functions in audit logs.

**3.1.7 Discussion**

Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-
privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing
intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are
examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this
requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in
3.1.2.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise audits and reports the health of organizational privilege access models and identifies potential vulnerable attack paths and misconfigurations within the privilege access architecture scheme when used in conjunction with external logging solutions to satisfy this requirement.

## 3.3 - AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY


### 3.3.1

#### Basic Requirement

Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable the
monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity.

**3.3.1 Discussion**

An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized
system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as
those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments
in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can
include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative
privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging,
organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security
requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs.
For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file
access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific
circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect
of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.
Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related
events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are
distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-
based architectures.
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps,
source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or fail
indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes
can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state
of the system after the event occurred).
Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording
of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider
limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific
audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including
information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate
information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide
important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making.
\[SP 800-92\] provides guidance on security log management.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise audits and reports the health of organizational privilege access models and identifies potential vulnerable attack paths and misconfigurations within the privilege access architecture scheme when used in conjunction with external logging solutions to satisfy this requirement.

### 3.3.2

#### Basic Requirement

Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so
they can be held accountable for their actions.

**3.3.2 Discussion**

This requirement ensures that the contents of the audit record include the information needed to
link the audit event to the actions of an individual to the extent feasible. Organizations consider
logging for traceability including results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
connectivity, mobile device connection, communications at system boundaries, configuration
settings, physical access, nonlocal maintenance, use of maintenance tools, temperature and
humidity, equipment delivery and removal, system component inventory, use of mobile code, and
use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise collects and analyses information on all objects with in the Active Directory/Azure environment. Collected data can be used to examine the scope of access that individual network users are granted. When used with native system logs, BloodHound Enterprise can aid in activity attribution and auditing.

### 3.3.5

#### Basic Requirement

Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response
to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity

**3.3.5 Discussion**

Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that they do not
operate independently, but rather collectively. Regarding the assessment of a given organizational
system, the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or
at the organization level across all systems.

#### Solution


BloodHound Enterprise detects and assigns risk categories based on the percentage of the organizations environment that is exposed to an identity attack path. Risk categories reflect the percentage of assets within the organizational environment that are vulnerable, aiding analysis in determining the impact of an incident. Impact scores, scope of access, and native system logs can be used as compensating controls to satisfy this requirement.

## 3.4 - CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### 3.4.1

#### Basic Requirement

Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems
(including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective
system development life cycles

**3.4.1 Discussion**

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for
systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
future builds, releases, and changes to systems. Baseline configurations include information about
system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and update
and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings and
parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system
architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current enterprise architecture.
Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational
systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance includes reviewing and updating
the baseline configuration when changes are made based on security risks and deviations from the
established baseline configuration
Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include components
from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting
inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability
(e.g., system association, system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective
accountability of system components includes hardware inventory specifications, software license
information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or
devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include manufacturer,
device type, model, serial number, and physical location.
\[SP 800-128\] provides guidance on security-focused configuration management.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access and authorization levels within the enterprise. BloodHound Enterprise’s initial collection and scheduled collections can be used to establish and monitor your organizations identity baseline.

### 3.4.5

#### Basic Requirement

Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with
changes to organizational systems

**3.4.5 Discussion**

Any changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems can potentially have
significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only
qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including
upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
Access restrictions include physical and logical access control requirements, workflow automation,
media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than
directly into systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during certain specified
times). In addition to security concerns, commonly-accepted due diligence for configuration
management includes access restrictions as an essential part in ensuring the ability to effectively
manage the configuration.
\[SP 800-128\] provides guidance on configuration change control.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise collects information on all systems, users, and objects in a domain that are connected to the organizations Active Directory/Azure Environment. BloodHound Enterprise monitors the environment for the addition/removal of systems from the organizations environment.

### 3.4.6

#### Basic Requirement

Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational systems to provide
only essential capabilities

**3.4.6 Discussion**

Systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services
routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single
system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any
one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function
per component.
Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to
determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized
connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize network
scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as
firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited
functions, ports, protocols, and services

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise audits and reports the health of organizational privilege access models and identifies potential vulnerable attack paths and misconfigurations within the privilege access architecture scheme.

## 3.6 - INCIDENT RESPONSE


### 3.6.1

#### Basic Requirement

Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes
preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities

**3.6.1 Discussion**

Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent on the capabilities of
organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems.
Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of
mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling
capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business
owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel
security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk
executive.
As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is
linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that
the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users
may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system
administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and
incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery,
and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of
suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes
incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access
to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required.
\[SP 800-61\] provides guidance on incident handling. \[SP 800-86\] and \[SP 800-101\] provide guidance
on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. \[SP 800-161\] provides guidance on
supply chain risk managemen

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise provides visibility into the logical relationships and access scope for an organizational Active Directory/Azure environments. Proactively monitoring the organizational environment in conjunction with native security tools contributes to satisfying this requirement.

### 3.6.2

#### Basic Requirement

Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal
and external to the organization.

**3.6.2 Discussion**

Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining records about each
incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics,
evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a
variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network
monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports.
Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and
the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization. Suspected security incidents may
also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially
contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the
reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders,
directives, regulations, and policies.
\[SP 800-61\] provides guidance on incident handling.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise provides visibility into the logical relationships and access scope for an organizational Active Directory/Azure environments. Proactively monitoring the organizational environment in conjunction with native security tools contributes to satisfying this requirement.

## 3.11 - RISK ASSESSMENT


### 3.11.1

#### Basic Requirement

Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from the operation of
organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.

**3.11.1 Discussion**

Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Such risk
assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations,
organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of organizational systems.
Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors
operating systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational systems,
outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either formal or informal, can be conducted at the
organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level, and at any phase in
the system development life cycle.
\[SP 800-30\] provides guidance on conducting risk assessments.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access and authorization levels within the enterprise. BloodHound Enterprise’s scheduled collection feature is designed to continuously monitor your environment for Tier Zero risk exposure.

### 3.11.2

#### Basic Requirement

Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new
vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified.

**3.11.2 Discussion**

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, ensuring
that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not
overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are
discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential
vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability
analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can
employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static
analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews.
Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols,
and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly
configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.
To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability
Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for
vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential
vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the
nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the
subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization
to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the
sensitive nature of such scanning.
\[SP 800-40\] provides guidance on vulnerability management.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access and authorization levels within the enterprise. BloodHound Enterprise’s scheduled collection feature is designed to continuously monitor your environment for Tier Zero risk exposure.

### 3.11.3

#### Requirement

Remediate vulnerabilities in accordance with risk assessments.

**3.11.3 Discussion**

Vulnerabilities discovered, for example, via the scanning conducted in response to 3.11.2, are
remediated with consideration of the related assessment of risk. The consideration of risk
influences the prioritization of remediation efforts and the level of effort to be expended in the
remediation for specific vulnerabilities.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise provides remediation guidance related to scan findings to mitigate the impact of organizational identity attack path exposure.

## 3.12 - SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### 3.12.1

#### Basic Requirement

Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls
are effective in their application.

**3.12.1 Discussion**

Organizations assess security controls in organizational systems and the environments in which
those systems operate as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the
safeguards or countermeasures organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By
assessing the implemented security controls, organizations determine if the security safeguards or
countermeasures are in place and operating as intended. Security control assessments ensure that
information security is built into organizational systems; identify weaknesses and deficiencies early
in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions;
and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the
implemented security controls as documented in system security plans.
Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary
by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the
security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results are provided
to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted.

Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination
of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor
independence. Organizations can choose to use other types of assessment activities such as
vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of systems during
the system life cycle.
\[SP 800-53\] provides guidance on security and privacy controls for systems and organizations. \[SP
800-53A\] provides guidance on developing security assessment plans and conducting assessments.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and catalogues all Active Directory/Azure accounts during its collection process. The collected accounts are analyzed and displayed in graph format to illustrate the various relationships and permission profiles in order to easily audit/verify access and authorization levels within the enterprise. BloodHound Enterprise’s scheduled collection feature is designed to continuously monitor your environment for Tier Zero risk exposure. BloodHound Enterprise’s reporting feature can be used to asses the effectiveness identity and access control systems.

### 3.12.2

#### Basic Requirement

Develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or
eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational systems.

**3.12.2 Discussion**

The plan of action is a key document in the information security program. Organizations develop
plans of action that describe how any unimplemented security requirements will be met and how
any planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document the system security
plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any chosen format.
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical
inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted
by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with
the nonfederal organization. \[NIST CUI\] provides supplemental material for Special Publication
800-171 including templates for plans of action.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise provides remediation guidance related to scan findings to mitigate the impact of organizational identity attack path exposure. Findings are given a criticality rating based on identity exposure contributing to the prioritization of remedial actions when executing a response plan.

### 3.12.3

#### Basic Requirement

Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the
controls.

**3.12.3 Discussion**

Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and
information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous
and ongoing imply that organizations assess and analyze security controls and information
security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. The results of
continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations.
Providing access to security information on a continuing basis through reports or dashboards gives
organizational officials the capability to make effective and timely risk management decisions.
Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, firmware inventories, and
other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs
are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.
Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may also be referenced in
other requirements.
\[SP 800-137\] provides guidance on continuous monitoring.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise scheduled and on-demand collection scans will gather information in accordance with organizational security policy and report all identity attack path vulnerabilities and misconfigurations found during scan and data analysis actions

## 3.14 - SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY


### 3.14.1

#### Basic Requirement

Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner.

**3.14.1 Discussion**

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include
patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered
during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error
handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in
remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems.
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary
based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability
related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than
other types of remediation.
\[SP 800-40\] provides guidance on patch management technologies.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise scheduled and on-demand collection scans will gather information in accordance with organizational security policy and report all identity attack path vulnerabilities and misconfigurations found during scan and data analysis actions.

### 3.14.2

#### Basic Requirement

Provide protection from malicious code at designated locations within organizational systems.

**3.14.2 Discussion**

Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, remote-
access servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and
spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained
within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography.
Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic
mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur
through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-
based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational
missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always
detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including
secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes,
and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the
functions intended.
\[SP 800-83\] provides guidance on malware incident prevention.

#### Solution

BloodHound Enterprise scheduled and on-demand collection scans will gather information in accordance with organizational security policy and report all identity attack path vulnerabilities and misconfigurations found during scan and data analysis actions. BloodHound Enterprise can be configured to monitor organizational specific assets and provide proactive risk assessment with associated assets as part of scheduled collection scans to satisfy this requirement.
