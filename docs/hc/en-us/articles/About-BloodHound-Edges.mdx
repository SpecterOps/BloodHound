 For example, the image below shows three User nodes (left side) connected to one Group node (right side), via the “MemberOf” edge, indicating the three users belong to the group:

</Frame>

The direction of the edge, indicated by the arrow, always indicates the direction of attack or privilege. From the above example, because all three users have a "MemberOf" edge pointing towards the group, all three users have the same privileges as the group.

Clicking on an Edge's name/label in the graph shows its properties in the Entity Panel:

Edges have only a few properties, which always include the following:

* Source Node
* Target Node
* Last Collected by BloodHound

Each article in this section documents an individual edge, and each contains:

* A description of the edge.
* **Abuse Info:** How red teamers can use the privilege of the edge to obtain their goals.
* **Opsec Considerations:** What red teamers should consider avoiding detection and thereby increasing **op**erational **sec**urity.
* **References:** Links to publicly available sources used to create the above information.

Note that edge names indicate what directory they apply to; all Azure and Entra ID edges are prefixed with "AZ", while Active Directory edges have no prefix.
