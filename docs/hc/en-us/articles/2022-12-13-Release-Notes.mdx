### BloodHound Enterprise

* Improved Functionality
    * The Modify Tier Zero view now includes a domain selector to filter only the objects within a single domain. For customers with many domains or Tier Zero objects, this will help make reviewing and modifying those objects a more streamlined task.

* Bug Fixes
    * Collection jobs queued back-to-back and analyzed together should no longer appear stuck in the "Ingesting" state in the Finished Jobs log. This primarily affects customers with many collectors or who queue multiple collections manually, one after the other.
    * Small fixes to the API documentation.
