### BloodHound (v5.12.0)

#### New and Improved Features

* **\[BHE Only\] Attack Paths view visual overhaul** \- The Attack Paths page has undergone a pretty significant overhaul. These changes include a better use of screen real-estate, and bring several key metrics to the forefront of the page, making it easier to rapidly identify current posture and recent changes.

* **Administrative page documentation** \- Each of the administrative pages now has a handy explainer for the purpose of the page and links directly to BloodHound Enterprise documentation relevant to the page. These changes will make it easier to find details around the changes you're making to your environment.**

* **Improved analysis performance: SyncLAPSPassword** \- We've updated the logic which results in the SyncLAPSPassword edges in BloodHound. With this change, these edges will more commonly begin from Groups which have this Attack Path primitive within an environment, rather than beginning directly from each user. The result of these changes is the creation of fewer edges during analysis, and improved performance during this step.
    _
    Note: This may result in some changes for Attack Path findings in BloodHound Enterprise environments._
* **Example Azure data is now available** \- Looking for sample data to try out BloodHound? We've got both AD and Azure sets hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/wiki/Example-Data)!
