* Bug Fixes
    * In some instances, on SharpHound 2.X, BloodHound Enterprise did not properly resolve the removal of local group memberships. This has been resolved, however, requires a collection of local groups for the fix to take effect in your environment.
    * BloodHound Enterprise would occasionally hang during analysis for customers with multiple domains due to a deadlock condition. This has been resolved.
    * Resolved an issue in which the Data Quality page would not load properly.
    * Finished Jobs now increment by one on each job run on a collector (previously, this would increase by two in certain cases).
