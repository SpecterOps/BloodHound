## Purpose

This article outlines the configuration files of BloodHound Community Edition (BHCE) installed with Docker Compose and how to configure them.

For a more advanced walkthrough of the deployment process, read our deployment [README.MD](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound#readme) in GitHub.

**NOTE: Do not follow this guide if you intend to expose the databases outside of Docker. Use the instructions in README.MD to make sure you change the default database passwords accordingly.**

## Prerequisites

Running the example Docker Compose project requires the following:

* A Docker-compatible container runtime, for example, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman (with Docker compatibility enabled)](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-docker-compose)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (automatically included with Docker Desktop)

The simplest way to get started is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), as it will provide both prerequisites and require no additional configuration.

## Process

**Optional:** One-line command for Steps 1 & 2
```json
curl -L https://ghst.ly/getbhce | docker compose -f - up
```
_On Windows, execute the command in CMD, or use "curl.exe" instead of "curl" in PowerShell._

1.  Download the [Docker Compose YAML file](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/blob/main/examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) and save it to a directory where you'd like to run BHCE.
    * On Linux/Mac: `curl -L https://ghst.ly/getbhce > .\docker-compose.yml`
    * On Windows, from CMD: `curl -L https://ghst.ly/getbhce > .\docker-compose.yml`
    * On Windows, from PowerShell: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://ghst.ly/getbhce -OutFile .\docker-compose.yaml`
2.  Navigate to the folder with the saved `docker-compose.yaml` file and run `docker compose pull && docker compose up`.
    * To run BHCE without the need to maintain the terminal interface, use `docker compose up -d`, and then `docker compose logs` to see the most recent logs from the environment.
3.  Locate the randomly generated password in the terminal output of Docker Compose.

    * The password cannot be regenerated. If you lost the password, simply run `docker compose down -v` and then `docker compose up` to reset your databases.
4.  In a browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/ui/login](http://localhost:8080/ui/login). Login with the username `admin` and the randomly generated password from the logs.

Note: The default `docker-compose.yml` example binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1). If you want to access BHCE outside of localhost, you'll need to follow the instructions in examples/docker-compose/README.md to configure the host binding for the container.

## Outcome

At the completion of this process, users will be logged into a locally hosted BHCE tenant running with Docker Compose.
