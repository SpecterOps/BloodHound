## Abuse Info

Via the Azure portal:

1.  Find the group in your tenant (Microsoft Entra ID -> Manage -> Groups -> Find Group in list)
2.  Click the group from the list
3.  In the overview, click “View group memberships”
4.  At the top, click “Add memberships”
5.  Find the principals you want to add to the group and click them, then click “select” at the bottom
6.  You should see a message in the top right saying “Successfully added membership”

Via PowerZure:

Add-AzureADGroup -User \[UPN\] -Group \[Group name\]

## Opsec Considerations

The Azure activity log for the tenant will log who added what principal to what group, including the date and time.
