## SpecterOps ❤️ Community

We at SpecterOps love the security community, and BloodHound as it stands today could not have been without the community.

SpecterOps employees have made countless community contributions through blog posts, public research, and open-source security tooling. We have trained thousands of students in our adversary-focused training courses and helped hundreds of customers with adversary simulation and detection assessments.

Join us in the [BloodHound Gang Slack](https://ghst.ly/BHSlack) where the community of BloodHound and adversary-focused security is gathered.

Have a bug report, feature request, or contribution? See below.

## BloodHound Enterprise support
