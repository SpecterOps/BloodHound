Purpose
=======

This article outlines how to mute a principal in an attack path finding so it is hidden in the principal table of the finding. It should be used by BHE users whenever a risk has been decided to be accepted or [while waiting for a change to leave its retention period](/hc/en-us/articles/18305386717723-Data-reconciliation-and-retention).

Prerequisites
=============

* Logged in as a user role which is authorized to mute attack path impacted principals, see [Administering users and roles](/hc/en-us/articles/16372343366939-Administering-users-and-roles).

3.  In the pop-up window \`Mute Attack Path\`, set the number of days the finding's principal should be muted and click the button \`MUTE\`.
    * If muting permanently: set the duration for a long duration.
    * If muting while while waiting for a change to leave it's retention period: set the duration depending on the retention scenario, for example when muting a principal from \`Logons from Tier Zero Users\` the duration should be 7 days.
