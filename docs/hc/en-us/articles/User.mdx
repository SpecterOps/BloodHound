| ACL Inheritance Denied | Identifies whether an object is allowing ACL inheritance to itself. |
| Admin Count | Whether the object currently, or possibly ever has belonged to a certain set of highly privileged groups. For Active Directory nodes this is related to the AdminSDHolder object and the SDProp process. Read more about that [here.](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2053) |
