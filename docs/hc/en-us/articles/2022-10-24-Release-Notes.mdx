## Announcements

### SharpHound Early Access Notice

**All customers participating in the User Rights Assignment Early Access Program must update SharpHound to v2.0.3.**

BloodHound Enterprise will no longer ingest data from SharpHound v2.0.0, v2.0.1, and v2.0.2 due to issues identified in those versions. Customer Success will follow up with affected customers directly to confirm upgrades.

### AD Certificate Services Design Partners Needed

Our research team is in the thick of evaluating and expanding upon [Will Schroeder and Lee Christensen's work on AD Certificate Services abuses](https://posts.specterops.io/certified-pre-owned-d95910965cd2) for implementation within BloodHound and BloodHound Enterprise. We are looking for several design partners to support our team in this effort over the coming months.

Initially, our team needs more information on common deployment technologies within production environments. If you would be willing to have a quick conversation with our team to elaborate on how you've deployed ADCS within your environment, please contact your TAM or reply to this email.
