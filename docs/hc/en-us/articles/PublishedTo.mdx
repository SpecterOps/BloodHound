The certificate template is published to an enterprise certification authority. This relationship means
the certificate template can be used when submitting an enrollment request to the specified
certification authority.

Abuse Info[](#h_01HPHZJSTFS46D4BFVYAB25KTE)
-------------------------------------------

An attacker may perform several attacks that rely on a template being published to a certification authority. This relationship alone is not enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals. This relationship may contribute to other relationships and attributes, from which an escalation opportunity may emerge.

Opsec Considerations[](#heading-2)
----------------------------------

When an attacker abuses an escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on a template being published to a certification authority, a copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
