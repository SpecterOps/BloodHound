AZOwns targets resources in Entra ID (for example [AZGroup](/hc/en-us/articles/17661189137691-AZGroup), [AZServicePrincipal](/hc/en-us/articles/17661309436827-AZServicePrincipal), and [AZDevice](/hc/en-us/articles/17661178331803-AZDevice)) from various object-specific ownership.

<Info>
  **Note: The edges [AZOwner](/hc/en-us/articles/17361533739163-AZOwner) and [AZOwns](/hc/en-us/articles/17309616958875-AZOwns) are distinct as they each apply their own distinct identity and access management platform (AzureRM and Entra ID respectively) with distinct mechanics, abuse primitives, and remediation steps.**

## Abuse Info

Object ownership means almost all abuses are possible against the target object.

## Opsec Considerations
This depends on which abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log for each abuse action.
