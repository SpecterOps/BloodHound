    _**
* **Improved performance on AZResetPassword** \- AZResetPassword edges now always start with AzRole objects. While this changes the shape of the graph data slightly, it will result in significant performance improvements, particularly during post-processing of edges after a collection.

    _Note: This will result in a significant, expected decrease in AZResetPassword edges in BloodHound. Additionally, BHE customers will see a change in findings associated with this edge._
* **Expanded memory available for queries** \- The amount of memory available for all queries against the graph (including Cypher and entity panel queries) has been doubled by default, significantly reducing the likelihood of errors stemming from excessive resource consumption.
* **Disabling MFA on a user will provide a more explicit warning** \- Disabling MFA on a user will now make the risk of doing so clearer.

* **\[Included in BHE v5.2.0\] Custom user-saved Cypher queries** \- You can save your favorite Cypher queries directly in BloodHound. Write your query and click the "Save Query" button to give it a name and store it.
