This is also known as full control. This privilege allows the trustee to manipulate the target object however they wish.

## Abuse Info

### With GenericAll Over a Group

Full control of a group allows you to directly modify group membership of the group. For full abuse info in that scenario, see the Abuse Info section under the AddMembers edge.

### With GenericAll Over a User

You can reset user passwords with full control over user objects. For full abuse info about this attack, see the information under the ForceChangePassword edge.

You can write to the “msds-KeyCredentialLink” attribute on a user. Writing to this property allows an attacker to create “Shadow Credentials” on the object and authenticate as the principal using Kerberos PKINIT. See more information under the AddKeyCredentialLink edge.

Alternatively, you can write to the "servicePrincipalNames" attribute and perform a targeted kerberoasting attack. See the abuse section under the WriteSPN edge for more information.

### With GenericAll Over a Computer

You may read the LAPS password of the computer object. See more information under the ReadLAPSPassword edge.

You can write to the “msds-KeyCredentialLink” attribute on a computer. Writing to this property allows an attacker to create “Shadow Credentials” on the object and authenticate as the computer using Kerberos PKINIT. See more information under the AddKeyCredentialLink edge.

Alternatively, Full control of a computer object can be used to perform a Resource-Based Constrained Delegation attack. See more information under the AllowedToAct edge.

### With GenericAll Over a GPO

With full control of a GPO, you may make modifications to that GPO which will then apply to the users and computers affected by the GPO. Select the target object you wish to push an evil policy down to, then use the gpedit GUI to modify the GPO, using an evil policy that allows item-level targeting, such as a new immediate scheduled task. Then wait at least 2 hours for the group policy client to pick up and execute the new evil policy. See the references tab for a more detailed write up on this abuse

### With GenericAll Over an OU

With full control of an OU, you may add a new ACE on the OU that will inherit down to the objects under that OU. Below are two options depending on how targeted you choose to be in this step:

#### Generic Descendent Object Takeover

The simplest and most straight forward way to abuse control of the OU is to apply a GenericAll ACE on the OU that will inherit down to all object types. Again, this can be done using PowerView. This time we will use the New-ADObjectAccessControlEntry, which gives us more control over the ACE we add to the OU.

First, we need to reference the OU by its ObjectGUID, not its name. You can find the ObjectGUID for the OU in the BloodHound GUI by clicking the OU, then inspecting the _objectid_ value

Next, we will fetch the GUID for all objects. This should be ‘00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000’:
```json
$Guids = Get-DomainGUIDMap
$AllObjectsPropertyGuid = $Guids.GetEnumerator() | ?{$_.value -eq 'All'} | select -ExpandProperty name
```
Then we will construct our ACE. This command will create an ACE granting the “JKHOLER” user full control of all descendant objects:
```json
ACE = New-ADObjectAccessControlEntry -Verbose -PrincipalIdentity 'JKOHLER' -Right GenericAll -AccessControlType Allow -InheritanceType All -InheritedObjectType $AllObjectsPropertyGuid
```
Finally, we will apply this ACE to our target OU:
```json
$OU = Get-DomainOU -Raw (OU GUID)
$DsEntry = $OU.GetDirectoryEntry()
$dsEntry.PsBase.Options.SecurityMasks = 'Dacl'
$dsEntry.PsBase.ObjectSecurity.AddAccessRule($ACE)
$dsEntry.PsBase.CommitChanges()
```
Now, the “JKOHLER” user will have full control of all descendent objects of each type.

#### Targeted Descendent Object Takeover

If you want to be more targeted with your approach, it is possible to specify precisely what right you want to apply to precisely which kinds of descendent objects. You could, for example, grant a user “ForceChangePassword” privilege against all user objects, or grant a security group the ability to read every GMSA password under a certain OU. Below is an example taken from PowerView’s help text on how to grant the “ITADMIN” user the ability to read the LAPS password from all computer objects in the “Workstations” OU:
```json
$Guids = Get-DomainGUIDMap
$AdmPropertyGuid = $Guids.GetEnumerator() | ?{$_.value -eq 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd'} | select -ExpandProperty name
$CompPropertyGuid = $Guids.GetEnumerator() | ?{$_.value -eq 'Computer'} | select -ExpandProperty name
$ACE = New-ADObjectAccessControlEntry -Verbose -PrincipalIdentity itadmin -Right ExtendedRight,ReadProperty -AccessControlType Allow -ObjectType $AdmPropertyGuid -InheritanceType All -InheritedObjectType $CompPropertyGuid
$OU = Get-DomainOU -Raw Workstations
$DsEntry = $OU.GetDirectoryEntry()
$dsEntry.PsBase.Options.SecurityMasks = 'Dacl'
$dsEntry.PsBase.ObjectSecurity.AddAccessRule($ACE)
$dsEntry.PsBase.CommitChanges()
```
#### Objects for which ACL inheritance is disabled

Generic/Targeted Descendent Object Takeover only works if the target object has ACL inheritance enabled. Alternatively, you can compromise target objects by abusing write access to the gPLink attribute of the OU. See the [WriteGPLink](/hc/en-us/articles/29117665141915-WriteGPLink) edge documentation for details.

### With GenericAll Over a Domain Object

#### DCSync

Full control of a domain object (the head object of the Default Naming Context) grants you both DS-Replication-Get-Changes as well as DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All rights. See the [DCSync](/hc/en-us/articles/17322385609371-DCSync) edge documentation for abuse details.

#### Generic/Targeted Descendent Object Takeover

With full control of a domain node, you may add a new ACE on the domain that will inherit down to all the objects with ACL inheritance enabled in the domain.

See the the sections "Generic Descendent Object Takeover" and "Targeted Descendent Object Takeover" under [With GenericAll Over an OU](#h_01HM28BQ05RS9DY84W2B93MJ0T). 

#### Objects for which ACL inheritance is disabled

Generic/Targeted Descendent Object Takeover only works if the target object has ACL inheritance enabled. Alternatively, you can compromise target objects by abusing write access to the gPLink attribute of the domain. See the [WriteGPLink](/hc/en-us/articles/29117665141915-WriteGPLink) edge documentation for details. 

### With GenericAll Over a CertTemplate

With GenericAll permission over a certificate template, you may be able to perform an ESC4 attack by modifying the template's attributes. BloodHound will in that case create an ADCSESC4 edge from the principal to the forest domain node.

### With GenericAll Over an EnterpriseCA

With GenericAll permission over an enterprise CA, you can publish certificate templates to the enterprise CA by adding the CN name of the template in the enterprise CA object's certificateTemplates attribute. This action may enable you to perform an ADCS domain escalation.

### With GenericAll Over a RootCA

With GenericAll permission over a root CA, you can make a rouge certificate trusted as a root CA in the AD forest by adding the certificate in the root CA object's cACertificate attribute. This action may enable you to perform an ADCS domain escalation.

### With GenericAll Over a NTAuthStore

With GenericAll permission over a NTAuth store, you can make an enterprise CA certificate trusted for NT (domain) authentication the AD forest by adding the certificate in the root CA object's cACertificate attribute. This action may enable you to perform an ADCS domain escalation. This action may enable you to perform an ADCS domain escalation.

### With GenericAll Over an IssuancePolicy

With GenericAll permission over an issuance policy object, you create a OID group link to a targeted group by adding the groups distinguishedName in the msDS-OIDToGroupLink attribute of the issuance policy object. This action may enable you to gain membership of the group through an ADCS ESC13 attack.

## Opsec Considerations

This will depend on the actual attack performed. See the particular opsec considerations sections for the ForceChangePassword, AddMembers, and GenericAll edges for more info.
