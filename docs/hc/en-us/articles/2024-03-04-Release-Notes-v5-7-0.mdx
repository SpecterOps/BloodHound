### BloodHound (v5.7.0)[](#h_01H93N41YNHMSBBACC28P2T428)

#### New and Improved Features

* **AD Certificate Services ESC 6b / 9b / 10b -** AD Certificate Services Attack Paths are incredibly complex, with each escalation path containing multiple variations. Our first variation on an existing path set expands BloodHound's ability to identify ADCS Attack Paths within your environment. For BloodHound Enterprise users, these will automatically appear as Attack Path findings if present in your environment.
* **Reduced memory impact during data ingest -** While applicable to both products, this change will be most noticeable to BloodHound CE users as data ingest now utilizes a streamed ingest parser, significantly reducing the amount of memory utilized during data ingestion.

    _Our engineering team is actively pursuing support for ZIP file ingest, and expect to deliver that in our next release!_
* **Improved visualization of edges that begin and end at the same node** \- Sometimes, a picture best describes a change!
