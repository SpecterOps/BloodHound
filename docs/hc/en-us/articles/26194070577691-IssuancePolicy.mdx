## Representation

The IssuancePolicy node represents the Active Directory LDAP objects of the _msPKI-Enterprise-Oid_ class located in the _OID_ container in the Configuration Naming Context.

## Node properties

The node supports the properties of the table. Three types of property names will be used, depending on where the property is found:

* **Entity Panel:** Name shown in the BloodHound UI.
* **Database:** Name stored in the BloodHound database and returned by the BloodHound API. This is to be used when running Cypher queries.
* **Directory:** Name collected from the directory the node is stored in, for example, the LDAP name for an Active Directory property.
