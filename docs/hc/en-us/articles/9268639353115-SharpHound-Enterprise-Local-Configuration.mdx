The local configuration of SharpHound Enterprise occurs within two files: [settings.json](#h_01HCMSM9D1GZPQS4YZYP9W2XM8) and [auth.json](#BloodHoundEnterpriseFAQ-SharpHoundsettings.jsonblank), their file paths can be found in the table below. Note that %AppData% is the directory of the service account: "C:\\Users\\SERVICE_ACCOUNT$\\AppData\\Roaming".

| **SharpHound File** | **Default Path (v2.5.8+)  <br/>** | **Default Path (\v2.5.8)  <br/>** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration File | %AppData%\\AppData\\Roaming\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\settings.json | C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SHService\\settings.json |
| Authentication File | %AppData%\\AppData\\Roaming\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\auth.json | C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SHService\\auth.json |
| Active Logs | %AppData%\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\*.log | %AppData%\\Roaming\\BloodHound Enterprise\\*.log |

## Settings Files

### settings.json

Plaintext JSON file that defines information about how the service behaves, such as settings for connecting to the BloodHound Enterprise tenant, connecting to Active Directory, and writing logs.

An example of the file:
```json

"LDAPPort": 389,
"ForceLDAPSSL": false,
"NumWorkers": 50,
"PartitionLDAPQueries": true,

### auth.json

auth.json is a plaintext JSON file that defines the credentials the service will utilize to authenticate to the BloodHound Enterprise API. Creating a new client or rotating the credentials of an existing one will provide you with the complete JSON structure used for a SharpHound Enterprise client.

An example of the file:
```json
{
"Token": "w4Tc+heVmaMTWgodlw0YlztaEGG53J/mwogiEZLvKE6WtylfYuoVEA==",
"TokenID": "0c6120ee-2fbe-478f-a864-2e264f9c16d2"

The following table outlines supported fields and their default values:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default value** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token | String | Used by SharpHound Enterprise to authenticate with the the BloodHound Enterprise tenant. | null | "w4Tc+heVmaMTWgodlw0YlztaEGG53J/mwogiEZLvKE6WtylfYuoVEA==" |
