The attacker principal has the ability to write to the msPKI-Certificate-Name-Flag attribute on the victim principal, which allows the attacker principal to configure "enrollee supplies subject" for the certificate template and other settings.

Abuse Info[](#h_01HPHZJSTFS46D4BFVYAB25KTE)
-------------------------------------------

This relationship alone is not enough to perform a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive. This relationship may contribute to other relationships and attributes, from which an escalation opportunity may emerge.

Opsec Considerations[](#heading-2)
----------------------------------

When an attacker abuses a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on this relationship, it will necessarily result in the issuance of a certificate. A copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
