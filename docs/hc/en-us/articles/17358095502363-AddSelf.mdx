title: AddSelf
description: "This edge indicates the principal has the ability to add itself to the target security group. Because of security group delegation, the members of a security group have the same privileges as that group."

By adding yourself to a group and refreshing your token, you gain all the same privileges that group has.

See this clip for an example of this edge being abused:

## Abuse Info

There are at least two ways to execute this attack. The first and most obvious is by using the built-in net.exe binary in Windows (e.g.: net group “Domain Admins” dfm.a /add /domain). See the opsec considerations tab for why this may be a bad idea. The second, and highly recommended method, is by using the Add-DomainGroupMember function in PowerView. This function is superior to using the net.exe binary in several ways. For instance, you can supply alternate credentials, instead of needing to run a process as or logon as the user with the AddSelf privilege. Additionally, you have much safer execution options than you do with spawning net.exe (see the opsec tab).

To abuse this privilege with PowerView’s Add-DomainGroupMember, first import PowerView into your agent session or into a PowerShell instance at the console.

You may need to authenticate to the Domain Controller as the user with the AddSelf right if you are not running a process as that user. To do this in conjunction with Add-DomainGroupMember, first create a PSCredential object (these examples comes from the PowerView help documentation):

```bash
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('TESTLAB\\dfm.a', $SecPassword)
```

Then, use Add-DomainGroupMember, optionally specifying $Cred if you are not already running within a process owned by the user with the AddSelf privilege

```bash
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -Members 'harmj0y' -Credential $Cred
```

Finally, verify that the user was successfully added to the group with PowerView’s Get-DomainGroupMember:

```bash
Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins'
```

## Opsec Considerations

Executing this abuse with the net binary will require command line execution. If your target organization has command line logging enabled, this is a detection opportunity for their analysts.

Regardless of what execution procedure you use, this action will generate a 4728 event on the domain controller that handled the request. This event may be centrally collected and analyzed by security analysts, especially for groups that are obviously very high privilege groups (i.e.: Domain Admins). Also be mindful that Powershell 5 introduced several key security features such as script block logging and AMSI that provide security analysts another detection opportunity.

You may be able to completely evade those features by downgrading to PowerShell v2.
