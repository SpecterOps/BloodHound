## Abuse Info

Find the user in the Azure portal, then click “Reset Password”, or use PowerZure’s Set-AzureUserPassword cmdlet. If password write-back is enabled, this password will also be set for a synced on-prem user.

## Opsec Considerations

Azure will log each password reset event, including who performed the reset, against which account, and at what date and time.
