* ⚖️ What options does Exchange give you..?
* 🔎 ...and are they really options?
* ✅ How to reduce those privileges the right way!

### BloodHound (v5.8.0)

#### New and Improved Features

* **File Ingest now supports .ZIP format and large files** \- by popular demand, BloodHound can now directly ingest .zip archives in the File Ingest feature, and the size limits have been removed from the UI. With this change, your browser's ability to package the uploaded file will remain the limiting factor in uploading large datasets directly through the UI.
* **Clear database option -** Did you accidentally upload bad data or need to start fresh?BloodHound has you covered with the built-in ability to clear various data! As the warning below shows, changes in this section are irreversible. These options are available to users with the Administrator role under the Administration -> Database Management section.
