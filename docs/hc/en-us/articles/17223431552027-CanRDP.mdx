This edge will be created under the condition that the user both has membership in Remote Desktop Users and is granted the URA SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight. Respectively these two are visualized in BloodHound by the edges  [MemberOfLocalGroup](/hc/en-us/articles/17273173878555-MemberOfLocalGroup) and [RemoteInteractiveLogonPrivilege](/hc/en-us/articles/17273195648923-RemoteInteractiveLogonPrivilege).

**Note**

  This edge does not guarantee privileged execution.

## Abuse Info

Abuse of this privilege will depend heavily on the type of access you have.

### PlainText Credentials with Interactive Access

With plaintext credentials, the easiest way to exploit this privilege is using the built-in Windows Remote Desktop Client (mstsc.exe). Open mstsc.exe and input the target computer name. When prompted for credentials, input the credentials for the user with RDP rights to initiate the remote desktop connection.

### Password Hash with Interactive Access

With a password hash, exploitation of this privilege will require local administrator privileges on a system, and the remote server must allow Restricted Admin Mode.

First, inject the NTLM credential for the user you’re abusing into memory using mimikatz:

```bash
lsadump::pth /user:dfm /domain:testlab.local /ntlm:<ntlm hash> /run:"mstsc.exe /restrictedadmin"
```

This will open a new RDP window. Input the target computer name to initiate the remote desktop connection. If the target server does not support Restricted Admin Mode, the session will fail.

### Plaintext Credentials without Interactive Access

This method will require some method of proxying traffic into the network, such as the socks command in Cobalt Strike, or direct internet connection to the target network, as well as the xfreerdp (suggested because of support of Network Level Authentication (NLA)) tool, which can be installed from the freerdp-x11 package. If using socks, ensure that proxychains is configured properly. Initiate the remote desktop connection with the following command:

```bash
proxychains xfreerdp /u:dfm /d:testlab.local /v:<computer ip>
```

xfreerdp will prompt you for a password, and then initiate the remote desktop connection.

Initiate the remote desktop connection with the following command:

```bash
proxychains xfreerdp /pth:<ntlm hash> /u:dfm /d:testlab.local /v:<computer ip>
```

This will initiate the remote desktop connection, and will fail if Restricted Admin Mode is not enabled.

## Opsec Considerations

If the target computer is a workstation and a user is currently logged on, one of two things will happen. If the user you are abusing is the same user as the one logged on, you will effectively take over their session and kick the logged on user off, resulting in a message to the user. If the users are different, you will be prompted to kick the currently logged on user off the system and log on. If the target computer is a server, you will be able to initiate the connection without issue provided the user you are abusing is not currently logged in.

Remote desktop will create Logon and Logoff events with the access type RemoteInteractive.
