In the top left of the GUI is the search bar. Start typing the name of a node, and the GUI will automatically recommend nodes that match what you’ve typed so far. Click one of the suggestions, and the GUI will render that node.

You can also constrain your search to particular node types by prepending your search with the appropriate node label. Supported node names can be found in the [Nodes section](/hc/en-us/sections/Nodes).

For example, you can search for group nodes containing the word “admin” with this search:
```
group:admin
```
