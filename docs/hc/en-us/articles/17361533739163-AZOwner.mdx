AZOwner targets resources in AzureRM (for example [AZResourceGroup](/hc/en-us/articles/17661280477979-AZResourceGroup), [AZSubscription](/hc/en-us/articles/17661310685339-AZSubscription), and [AZVM](/hc/en-us/articles/17661353784603-AZVM)) through role assignment called "Owner".

**Note: The edges [AZOwner](/hc/en-us/articles/17361533739163-AZOwner) and [AZOwns](/hc/en-us/articles/17309616958875-AZOwns) are distinct as they each apply their own distinct identity and access management platform (AzureRM and Entra ID respectively) with distinct mechanics, abuse primitives, and remediation steps.**

## Abuse Info

Everything a Contributor can do, with the addition of assigning rights to resources. Object ownership means almost all abuses are possible against the target object.

## Opsec Considerations

This depends on which abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log for each abuse action.
