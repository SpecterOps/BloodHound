## Abuse Info

The Enroll permission grants enrollment rights on the certificate template.Â 

The following additional requirements must be met for a principal to be able to enroll a certificate:

1.  The certificate template is published on an enterprise CA
2.  The principal has Enroll permission on the enterprise CA
3.  The principal meets the issuance requirements and the requirements for subject name and subject alternative name defined by the template

Certify can be used to enroll a certificate on Windows:

```bash
Certify.exe request /ca:SERVER\\CA-NAME /template:TEMPLATE
```

Certipy can be used to enroll a certificate on Linux:

```bash
certipy req -u USER@CORP.LOCAL -p PWD -ca CA-NAME -target SERVER -template TEMPLATE
```

## Opsec Considerations

When an attacker abuses a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on this relationship, it will necessarily result in the issuance of a certificate. A copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
