### Upcoming Webinar: Using Apeman to Discover Attack Paths in AWS


Join SpecterOps red team operator Daniel Heinsen on Oct 31, 2024, as he showcases how Apeman can quickly identify Attack Paths by solving AWS CTF challenges. In solving these challenges, we will cover:

* Resource permission evaluation
* Identity Transformations
* Resultant Set of Policy

Each CTF challenge addressed will highlight a common misconfiguration and how Apeman can help identify them.
