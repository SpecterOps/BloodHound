## Abuse Info

With both GetChanges and GetChangesAll privileges in BloodHound, you may perform a dcsync attack to get the password hash of an arbitrary principal using mimikatz:

lsadump::dcsync /domain:testlab.local /user:Administrator

You can also perform the more complicated ExtraSids attack to hop domain trusts. For information on this see the blog post by harmj0y in the references tab.

## Opsec Considerations

For detailed information on detection of DCSync as well as opsec considerations, see the ADSecurity post in the references section below.
