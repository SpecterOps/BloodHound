BloodHound does not assess what principals the enrollment agent is allowed to enroll on behalf of.

## Abuse Info

An attacker may perform an ADCS ESC3 attack that relies on this DelegatedEnrollmentAgent relationship. This relationship alone is not enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals.

## Opsec Considerations

When an attacker abuses a privilege escalation or impersonation primitive that relies on this relationship, it will necessarily result in the issuance of a certificate. A copy of the issued certificate will be saved on the host that issued the certificate.
