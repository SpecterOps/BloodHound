The SharpHound Enterprise service is a critical element in your deployment that collects and uploads data about your environment to your BloodHound Enterprise instance for processing and analysis.

SharpHound Enterprise is deployed as a signed Windows service, runs under the context of a domain account, and collects from one or more domains utilizing the configured service account.

## Deployment Process Overview

To collect Active Directory data with SharpHound and ingest it into BloodHound for analysis:

1.  Provision a Server that meets or exceeds the recommended Hardware, Software, and Network requirements below.
2.  Create a Service Account or [gMSA](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-a-gMSA-for-use-with-SharpHound-Enterprise) that SharpHound will run as with the Service Account Requirements below.
3.  [Install and Upgrade SharpHound Enterprise](/hc/en-us/articles/Install-and-Upgrade-SharpHound-Enterprise)
4.  [Create a BloodHound Enterprise collector client](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-a-BloodHound-Enterprise-collector-client)
5.  [Run an On Demand Scan](/hc/en-us/articles/Run-an-On-Demand-Scan) or [Create a data collection schedule](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-a-data-collection-schedule)

## Server Requirements

### Hardware

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Minimum** | **Recommended** |
| **Processor Cores** | 2 physical cores | 4 physical cores |
| **Memory** | 4GB RAM | 16GB RAM |
| **Hard disk space** | 1GB for logging | 5GB for logging |

### Software

* Windows Server 2019+
* .NET 4.5.2+

### Network

* TLS on 443/TCP to your BloodHound Enterprise SaaS tenant URL (proxy is supported)
* LDAP to at least one domain controller in each domain requiring collection.
    * By default, SharpHound will attempt LDAP over SSL first, then fall back to LDAP if SSL is unavailable.
        * LDAP over SSL on 636/TCP (configurable port)
        * LDAP on 389/TCP (configurable port)
    * LDAP over SSL is enforceable.
    * [LDAP channel signing](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/ldap-channel-binding-and-signing) is used for all queries.
* \[Optional\] If performing privileged collection (see [Why perform privileged collection in SharpHound](/hc/en-us/articles/Why-perform-privileged-collection-in-SharpHound))
    * SMB/RPC on 445/TCP to all in-scope domain-joined Windows systems
    * Approximately 60-100kB network bandwidth per collection to each in-scope domain-joined Windows system
* \[Optional\] If performing DC Registry and DC Registry collection (see [DC Registry and CA Registry details](/hc/en-us/articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Data-Collection-and-Permissions#01HR6PT0BG44W65EJJ0WE4H63V))
    * SMB/RPC on 445/TCP to all DCs and domain-joined CAs

## Service Account Requirements

The SharpHound Enterprise service will run as a domain-joined account and will utilize the permissions of that account for enumeration purposes.

* Authenticated User within any domains requiring collection
* Granted "Log on as a service" User Rights Assignment on the SharpHound Enterprise server
* \[Optional\] If performing privileged collection (see [Why perform privileged collection in SharpHound](/hc/en-us/articles/Why-perform-privileged-collection-in-SharpHound))
    * Member of the local Administrators group on all in-scope domain-joined Windows systems
* \[Optional\] If performing DC Registry and DC Registry collection (see [DC Registry and CA Registry details](/hc/en-us/articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Data-Collection-and-Permissions))
    * Member of the local Administrators group on all domain controllers and domain-joined certificate authorities
* \[Optional\]: If Active Directory tombstoning is enabled
    * * Read privileges to the Deleted Objects container (see [How to let non-administrators view the Active Directory deleted objects container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/non-administrators-view-deleted-object-container))

See [SharpHound Data Collection and Permissions](/hc/en-us/articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Data-Collection-and-Permissions) for comprehensive requirement information.
