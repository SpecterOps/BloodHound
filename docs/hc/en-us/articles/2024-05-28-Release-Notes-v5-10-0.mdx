### BloodHound (v5.10.0)[](#h_01H93N41YNHMSBBACC28P2T428)


#### New and Improved Features

* **Improved Cypher quality controls** \- The BloodHound API performs several checks during Cypher queries to prevent failures due to resource exhaustion, etc. We've improved these processes to improve our customers' experience.
* **Example Active Directory data** \- Looking for sample data to try out BloodHound? We've got some hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/tree/main/examples/sample-data)!
* _\[BHE Only\]_ Updated reference links for all Attack Path findings - Attack Path references have all been updated to point toward our new documentation location!
* _\[CE Only__\]_ Enable graph mutation via Cypher - CE users may enable graph mutation via the \`bhe\_enable\_cypher_mutations\` environment variable! See line 35 [here](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/blob/main/examples/docker-compose/.env.example#L35).

#### Bug Fixes

* Entity panels will now appear regardless of the object type selected
* _\[CE Only\]_ Added missing package caches for offline builds
