Object owners retain the ability to modify object security descriptors, regardless of permissions on the object’s DACL

This clip shows an example of abusing object ownership:

Abuse Info[](#heading-1)
------------------------

With ownership of the object, you may modify the DACL of the object however you wish. For more information about that, see the WriteDacl edge section.

Opsec Considerations[](#heading-2)
----------------------------------

This depends on the target object and how to take advantage of this privilege.

When using the PowerView functions, keep in mind that PowerShell v5 introduced several security mechanisms that make it much easier for defenders to see what’s going on with PowerShell in their network, such as script block logging and AMSI. You can bypass those security mechanisms by downgrading to PowerShell v2, which all PowerView functions support.

Modifying permissions on an object will generate 4670 and 4662 events on the domain controller that handled the request.
