Set up BloodHound Community Edition (BloodHound CE) with Docker Compose and start identifying and visualizing security risks..

<Info> Are you a blue team looking to remediate security risks? [Request a demo of BloodHound Enterprise](https://specterops.io/get-a-demo/).</Info>


# Prerequisites

To complete the quickstart, ensure you meet these system requirements. 
BloodHound CE deploys in a traditional multi-tier container architecture consisting of databases, application, and UI layers.

| Minimum specifications | For large environments (>50K users)  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 4GB of RAM     | 96GB of RAM                    |
| 4 processor cores     | 12 processor cores                    |
| 10GB hard disk space   | 50GB hard disk space           |


# Install BloodHound CE

To install BloodHound CE:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). This gives you access to Docker Compose.

2. Download the [Docker Compose YAML file](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/blob/main/examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) and save it to a directory where you'd like to run BloodHound.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Linux/MAC
    curl -L https://ghst.ly/getbhce > .\docker-compose.yml
    ```
    
    ``` bash Windows CMD
    curl -L https://ghst.ly/getbhce > .\docker-compose.yml
    ```
    
    ```powershell Windows PowerShell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://ghst.ly/getbhce -OutFile .\docker-compose.yaml
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  The YAML configuration file sets up the app database (Postgres), the graph database (neo4j), and the BloodHound web service.

3. Go to the directory with the saved docker-compose.yml file and run:
    ```bash
    docker compose pull && docker compose up
    ```
    
    To run BloodHound CE without needing to maintain the terminal interface, add the flag `d` and run `docker compose logs` to see the most recent logs from the environment. 
    
    This pulls all the Docker images needed and runs Docker Compose to start up the services from the YAML configuration file.

4. In the terminal log output of Docker Compose, find and copy the randomly generated password from `Initial Password Set To`.
    
    <Warning>
      This password cannot be regenerated. If you lose it, run `docker compose down -v` and then `docker compose up` to reset your databases.
    </Warning>

5. Go to [http://localhost:8080/ui/login](http://localhost:8080/ui/login) and log in with the username `admin` and the password generated from the logs.
    
    <Note>
      The default `docker-compose.yml` example binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1). To access BloodHound outside of localhost, follow the instructions in [examples/docker-compose/README.md](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/blob/main/examples/docker-compose/README.md) to configure host binding for the container.
    </Note>

6. Reset the password as prompted.

You're now logged in to a locally hosted BloodHound CE tenant running with Docker Compose.

# Get data into BloodHound

To get data into BloodHound, ingest sample data or run a data collector.

## Option 1: Ingest sample data

Sample collection data helps you explore and test BloodHound CE functionality before using your own data.

To ingest the BloodHound sample data:

1. Go to [Example Data](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/wiki/Example-Data) and download sample data.

2. From the BloodHound CE UI, go to settings (⚙️) → **Administration** → **Upload Files**.
    
  <Note> The default admin email address is spam@example.com. You may notice this show up as the user who's ingesting the data.</Note>

## Option 2: Ingest your data with data collectors

BloodHound CE analyzes data collected by its two collector services, each collecting from a specific directory:
* Active Directory, collected by SharpHound CE
* Entra ID and Azure, collected by AzureHound CE

### Download collectors

Each collector is a standalone binary. Download collectors using one of these methods:
* From BloodHound CE, click ⚙️ → **Download Collectors** → the download button for **SHARPHOUND** or **AZUREHOUND**.
* Download the collector from their respective GitHub repository: [SharpHound repository](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound/releases) or [AzureHound repository](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/AzureHound/releases).
* Build the collector from source with the source code for [SharpHound](../articles/SharpHound-Community-Edition) or [AzureHound](../articles/AzureHound-Community-Edition).

### Run a collector
Run the SharpHound or AzureHound collector. During collection, JSON files are generated and compressed into a ZIP file.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Run SharpHound from a domain-joined Windows system
# Run SharpHound CE
C:\> SharpHound.exe
```

```bash Run AzureHound 
# Run AzureHound CE
C:\> AzureHound.exe --username "MattNelson@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" --password "MyVeryStrongPassword" --tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" list
```
</CodeGroup>
For Azure argument definitions, see [All AzureHound Community Edition Flags, Explained](../articles/All-AzureHound-Community-Edition-Flags-Explained).

### Ingest data into BloodHound

Use the BloodHound CE API or the BloodHound CE UI to ingest collected data into BloodHound.

To ingest collected data with the API, use the BloodHound CE endpoint `/api/v2/file-upload/`. See the [BloodHound API documentation](../articles/Working-with-the-BloodHound-API) for details.

To ingest collected data with the BloodHound CE UI, go to settings (⚙️) → **Administration → Data Collection →** select **File Ingest →** click **UPLOAD FILES** and upload your files.

BloodHound CE accepts .zip archives or JSON files, with no size limit. Your browser's ability to package the uploaded file is a limiting factor in uploading large datasets directly through the UI.

# Explore attack paths

To look at identified attack paths in the graph, go to the **Explore** page in the BloodHound CE UI.

<Steps>
 <Step title="Search for a user">
   1. In the **Search** bar, search nodes for a user like `user:bob`.
   2. Select the user and click on the node that appears.
   3. Explore information about the user's sessions and memberships.
 </Step>

 <Step title="Pathfind">
   Review the path from one user to another on the **Pathfinding** tab. For example, pathfind from `BOB` to `ADMINISTRATOR`.
 </Step>

 <Step title="Explore Cypher queries">
   Explore the pre-saved Cypher queries on the **Cypher** tab.
 </Step>
</Steps>
