Get started with your BloodHound Enterprise instance and start identifying and remediating security risks.

# Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must have a BloodHound Enterprise instance. To connect with the SpecterOps team and receive an instance, [request a demo of BloodHound Enterprise](https://specterops.io/get-a-demo/).

# Get data into BloodHound

BloodHound Enterprise analyzes data collected by its two collector services, each collecting from a specific directory:

* Active Directory, collected by SharpHound Enterprise
* Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Azure IaaS, collected by AzureHound Enterprise

You can run the two services from the same Windows system. AzureHound Enterprise also supports Docker and Kubernetes.

## Ingest with SharpHound Enterprise (Active Directory)

SharpHound Enterprise collects [multiple data types](../articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Data-Collection-and-Permissions) from Active Directory and its domain-joined systems. We recommend collecting all types for full risk identification and accurate risk assessment calculation.

Install the SharpHound Enterprise collector service on a domain-joined Windows system and run it as an Active Directory account.

  1. Review the [SharpHound Enterprise System Requirements](../articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-System-Requirements-and-Deployment-Process) and [SharpHound Service Hardening Guidelines](../articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Service-Hardening).
  2. [Install and Upgrade SharpHound Enterprise](../articles/Install-and-Upgrade-SharpHound-Enterprise).
  3. To fully secure a domain, collect data from all other domains with a trust relationship to it (in- and outgoing trust). Configure SharpHound Enterprise for [Cross-Trust Collection](../articles/SharpHound-Enterprise-Cross-Trust-Collection).

## Ingest with AzureHound Enterprise (Entra ID and Azure)

Install and run the AzureHound Enterprise collector service on Windows, Docker, or Kubernetes.

  1. Review the [AzureHound Enterprise System Requirements and Deployment Process](../articles/AzureHound-Enterprise-System-Requirements-and-Deployment-Process).
  2. [Configure Azure](../articles/AzureHound-Enterprise-Azure-Configuration).
  3. [Create your AzureHound configuration](../articles/Create-an-AzureHound-Configuration).
  4. [Deploy and maintain AzureHound](../articles/Install-and-Upgrade-AzureHound-Windows-Docker-or-Kubernetes).

# Verify data quality

After collecting data, to verify data quality:

  1. Go to settings (⚙️) → **Administration** and select **Data Quality**.
  2. Verify that the collectors have collected the expected amount of data and the number of principal types in each directory.
  3. If using privileged collection, verify that the charts **Local Group Completeness Over Time** and **Session Completeness Over Time** report higher than 0%. 
  
      Obtaining 100% completeness is not possible in most environments due to things like workstations being offline during collection.
  
  4. If you see lower-than-expected data quality examine the data collection logs and contact your SpecterOps representative if you need assistance.

# Scope Tier Zero objects

BloodHound Enterprise identifies and prioritizes attack paths. To get the most accurate assessment scope your Tier Zero objects.

  1. [Scope Tier Zero for your environment](../articles/Tier-Zero-Members-and-Modification).
  2. [Mark your environment's Tier Zero objects in BloodHound](../articles/Modifying-Tier-Zero).

# Grant users access

Your BloodHound Enterprise instance has a few administrative users by default. To bring your team into your instance, grant your team access with dedicated users and roles.

To grant users access to your instance, [create users and set access control roles](../articles/Administering-users-and-roles).

BloodHound Enterprise supports two authentication methods for users:

* Built-in authentication via username and password, supporting TOTP-based multi-factor authentication
* [SAML 2.0-based Single-Sign-On](../articles/SAML-in-BloodHound)

Your default users are configured with built-in authentication. For your team, you can also configure SAML authentication.

<Tip>Enable multi-factor authentication for all users, no matter the authentication method and user role. If using SAML authentication, your connected identity provider will handle multi-factor authentication.</Tip>

# Explore and remediate attack paths

Go to the **Attack Paths**, **Explore**, and **Posture** pages to see identified attack paths, prioritization, and recommended mitigations.
