<img src="/assets/enterprise-AND-community-edition-pill-tag.svg"/> 

The local configuration of SharpHound Enterprise occurs within two files: [settings.json](#settings-json) and [auth.json](#auth-json), their file paths can be found in the table below. Note that %AppData% is the directory of the service account: "C:\\Users\\SERVICE_ACCOUNT$\\AppData\\Roaming".

| **SharpHound File** | **Default Path (v2.5.8+)  <br/>** | **Default Path (\v2.5.8)  <br/>** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration File | %AppData%\\AppData\\Roaming\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\settings.json | C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SHService\\settings.json |
| Authentication File | %AppData%\\AppData\\Roaming\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\auth.json | C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SHService\\auth.json |
| Active Logs | %AppData%\\BloodHoundEnterprise\\*.log | %AppData%\\Roaming\\BloodHound Enterprise\\*.log |

3.  Start the SharpHound Enterprise service: "SharpHound Delegator"

## Settings Files

### settings.json

Plaintext JSON file that defines information about how the service behaves, such as settings for connecting to the BloodHound Enterprise tenant, connecting to Active Directory, and writing logs.

An example of the file:

```json
{
  "RestEndpoint": "CODENAME.bloodhoundenterprise.io",
  "RestPort": 443,
  "SSL": true,
  "CurrentJob": null,
  "LogLevel": "Information",
  "EnumerationLogLevel": "Information",
  "TempDirectory": "C:\\\Users\\\gmsa_SHS$\\\AppData\\\Roaming\\\BloodHoundEnterprise",
  "Proxy": null,
  "ComputerPasswordResetWindow": 60,
  "ForceLDAPKerberosAuth": true,
  "PortCheckTimeout": 10000,
  "LDAPSSLPort": 636,
  "LDAPPort": 389,
  "ForceLDAPSSL": false,
  "NumWorkers": 50,
  "PartitionLDAPQueries": true,
  "Version": "2.5.9.0"
}
```

The following table outlines supported fields and their default values:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default value** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RestEndpoint | String | Your tenant domain, as provided by your account team<br/><br/>This field should contain a domain only; do not include URI information such as "https://" | "CODENAME.bloodhoundenterprise.io" | "demo.bloodhoundenterprise.io" |
| RestPort | Integer | TCP port which BloodHound Enterprise API runs on. | 443 | 443 |
| SSL | Boolean | Is the API SSL enabled | True | True |
| CurrentJob | Array | SharpHound utilizes this field to track the currently running task. It will be null when no task is running. | Do not modify this value. | Do not modify this value. |
| LogLevel | String | Logging verbosity level for the service itself. These logs appear in service.log within the configured TempDirectory location.<br/><br/>The following levels are supported from most to least verbose (most typically used options are underlined):<br/><br/>* Trace<br/>* Debug<br/>* Information<br/>* Warning<br/>* Error<br/>* Critical<br/>* None | "Information" | "Trace" |
| EnumerationLogLevel | String | Logging verbosity level used during collection jobs. <br/><br/>The following levels are supported from most to least verbose (most typically used options are underlined):<br/><br/>* Trace<br/>* Debug<br/>* Information<br/>* Warning<br/>* Error<br/>* Critical<br/>* None | "Information" | "Trace" |
| TempDirectory | String | Directory in which logs and temporary files are stored. Upon service start, if this value is null, the service will default to the "%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\BloodHound Enterprise\\" directory belonging to the service user.<br/><br/>Logs are retained for 14 days.<br/><br/>Backslashes (\\) must be escaped for proper JSON formatting, i.e. double backslashes are required. | null | "C:\\\Users\\\**SERVICE_USER$**\\\ AppData\\\Roaming\\\BloodHound Enterprise\\\" |
| Proxy | String | HTTP Proxy URL if needed. | null | "proxy.acme.com:8080" |
| ComputerPasswordResetWindow | Integer | When performing local collections, any computer objects that have not rotated their password with the domain in this many days will be excluded. By default, computers in Active Directory rotated their passwords every 30 days.<br/><br/>_Minimum value: 7_  <br/>  <br/>This Windows setting specifies how often the computer will rotate its password: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/domain-member-maximum-machine-account-password-age](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/domain-member-maximum-machine-account-password-age)  <br/>  <br/>It is possible to prevent a Windows computer from rotating its password completely with this setting: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/domain-member-disable-machine-account-password-changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/domain-member-disable-machine-account-password-changes) | 60  | 365 |

Disabling this may be required to collect across an External trust type (see [Cross-Trust Collection here](/collect-data/enterprise-collection/cross-trust)).<br/><br/>Setting this value to False means that SharpHound will auto-negotiate authentication to domain controllers, preferring Kerberos if available. | False | True |
| PortCheckTimeout | Integer | In milliseconds, SharpHound will wait for a response on port 445/TCP before considering the system unavailable.<br/><br/>_Minimum value: 200_<br/><br/>_Requires SharpHound Enterprise v2.2.1+_ | 10000 | 15000 |

| Version | String | The current version of SharpHound Enterprise. | Do not modify this value. | Do not modify this value. |

### auth.json

auth.json is a plaintext JSON file that defines the credentials the service will utilize to authenticate to the BloodHound Enterprise API. Creating a new client or rotating the credentials of an existing one will provide you with the complete JSON structure used for a SharpHound Enterprise client.

An example of the file:
```json
{
"Token": "w4Tc+heVmaMTWgodlw0YlztaEGG53J/mwogiEZLvKE6WtylfYuoVEA==",
"TokenID": "0c6120ee-2fbe-478f-a864-2e264f9c16d2"
}
```
The following table outlines supported fields and their default values:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default value** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token | String | Used by SharpHound Enterprise to authenticate with the the BloodHound Enterprise tenant. | null | "w4Tc+heVmaMTWgodlw0YlztaEGG53J/mwogiEZLvKE6WtylfYuoVEA==" |
| TokenID | String | Unique identifier for the token. | null | "0c6120ee-2fbe-478f-a864-2e264f9c16d2" |
