_You will need your AzureHound Enterprise configuration file from [Create an AzureHound Configuration](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-an-AzureHound-Configuration) prior to beginning this process.


## Windows

### Install AzureHound Enterprise on Windows

This shows how to install AzureHound Enterprise as a service. Many organizations choose to run AzureHound Enterprise alongside SharpHound Enterprise from the same system. These services can live alongside each other and will not conflict.

Organizations who wish to run multiple AzureHound Enterprise collectors on the same server, for example, because of multiple Azure tenants, must install AzureHound Enterprise as Scheduled Tasks instead of Windows Services. See [Setting up multiple AzureHound collectors on the same server with scheduled tasks](/hc/en-us/articles/Running-multiple-AzureHound-Enterprise-collectors-on-one-server-with-Scheduled-Tasks).

1.  Follow the article [Create an AzureHound Configuration](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-an-AzureHound-Configuration) to create a configuration file.

2.  Create a directory for the AzureHound service binary. We recommend using "C:\\Program Files\\AzureHound Enterprise" as the Program Files directory is write-protected from non-administrative users.
```
    New-Item 'C:\\Program Files\\AzureHound Enterprise' -ItemType Directory
```
3.  Move "azurehound.exe" into the created directory
4.  Open a command line as a local administrator, navigate to the created directory, and run:
```
    azurehound.exe install
```
5.  Hit Enter, or type 'y', to use the previously created configuration file.
    * AzureHound will copy the configuration settings in your user profile to "C:\\ProgramData\\AzureHound\\config.json", this is a hardcoded configuration file location

6.  **If using certificate authentication:**
    * Copy the certificate and key file created in your user profile to a more central location, for example next to the configuration settings in "C:\\ProgramData\\azurehound"
```
    Move-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\\.config\\azurehound\\*.pem" "C:\\ProgramData\\azurehound\\"
```
    * Edit the configuration file in "C:\\ProgramData\\AzureHound\\config.json" and change the "cert" and "key" values to the new certificate and key file locations.

### Single run of AzureHound Enterprise on Windows

Instead of installing AzureHound as a service, it is also possible to run AzureHound a single time which runs until the command line is closed or the user logs off. This is often used in troubleshooting scenarios.

1.  Follow the article [Create an AzureHound Configuration](/hc/en-us/articles/Create-an-AzureHound-Configuration) to create a configuration file.
2.  Open a command line as a local administrator, navigate to the directory containing AzureHound Enterprise, and run:
```
    azurehound.exe start
```
3.  If the connection to BloodHound Enterprise is successful, the program will output "_Waiting for jobs..._".
    * In BloodHound Enterprise, the AzureHound collector client will now show "Status: Ready", and "Last Checkin: a few seconds ago"
<Frame>

4.  If needing to test AzureHound's connectitity to Azure; keep the command prompt open and follow [Run an On Demand Scan](/hc/en-us/articles/Run-an-On-Demand-Scan)
5.  When started and AzureHound has fetched the job, the command line will output data while the collection is running.
    * If successful, the final message will be "_Collection completed successfully_"
    * If unsuccessful, check the log for errors, or check the AzureHound log generated next to the binary, or contact the BloodHound Enterprise team for support.
