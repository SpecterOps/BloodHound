# Dogtags - SKU-Based Feature Entitlements

## 1. Overview

Dogtags is a provider-based system for managing feature entitlements. It abstracts where SKU level configuration comes from, allowing the same application code to work whether entitlements are sourced from a license file, a database, or some future backend we haven't thought of yet.

## 2. Motivation & Goals

BloodHound supports multiple deployment models with different configuration needs. Some deployments read entitlements from signed license files, others from a database. The application shouldn't care where the values come from.

-   **Abstraction** - Decouple feature checks from configuration source
-   **Extensibility** - Add new providers without touching application code
-   **Simplicity** - One interface for all entitlement lookups

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Provider Injection

Providers are injected at runtime. The application receives a configured provider at startup and uses it for all entitlement lookups. Provider implementation details are intentionally hidden from the application. The FOSS application uses a no-op provider, meaning default values in the SKU lookup field will apply.

### 3.2 Startup-Time Loading

Entitlements are loaded once at startup and cached. Changes require a restart. This is intentional; Runtime updates add complexity and create less predictable behavior.

### 3.3 Fail-Fast

If a provider can't load its configuration, the application fails to start. Silent fallbacks mask misconfigurations and make debugging painful.

### 3.4 Public Interfaces, Private Implementations

The dogtags interfaces and service layer live in this public repository, but the feature itself is enterprise-only. This is a deliberate pattern: CE ships with a `NoopProvider` that returns defaults, effectively disabling SKU-gated functionality. Enterprise builds inject real providers that source actual entitlements.

This lets us maintain a single codebase where enterprise features are structurally present but functionally inert in CE. Application code doesn't branch on "is this enterprise?" - it just asks dogtags for values and gets sensible defaults in CE.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Provider Interface

Providers implement a simple interface:

```go
type Provider interface {
    GetFlagAsBool(key string) (bool, error)
    GetFlagAsString(key string) (string, error)
    GetFlagAsInt(key string) (int64, error)
}
```

Providers return errors when a key isn't found. This lets the service layer decide whether to use defaults.

### 4.2 Service Layer

The service wraps providers and handles defaults. If a provider doesn't have a flag, the service falls back to the default defined in the SKU spec.

```go
type Service interface {
    GetFlagAsBool(key BoolDogTag) bool
    GetFlagAsString(key StringDogTag) string
    GetFlagAsInt(key IntDogTag) int64
    GetAllDogTags() map[string]any
}
```

Note the typed keys (`BoolDogTag`, `IntDogTag`, etc.) - this prevents mixing up flag types at compile time.

### 4.3 API Endpoint

Dogtags are exposed via `GET /api/v2/dog-tags`. The response is always a flat map (no nested objects). Keys use dot notation for namespacing (`namespace.key`), but this is purely a naming convention, not structure.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "privilege_zones.tier_limit": 3,
        "privilege_zones.label_limit": 10,
        "privilege_zones.multi_tier_analysis": false
    }
}
```

## 5. Adding a New SKU Flag

### 5.1 Define the Flag

Add to `bhce/cmd/api/src/services/dogtags/sku_flags.go`:

```go
const (
    MY_NEW_FEATURE BoolDogTag = "my_feature.enabled"
)

var AllBoolDogTags = map[BoolDogTag]BoolDogTagSpec{
    MY_NEW_FEATURE: {Description: "My New Feature", Default: false},
}
```

Pick a sensible default. This is what the service returns if a provider doesn't have the flag.

### 5.2 Configure Providers

Every provider must be updated to source the new flag's value. Consult provider-specific documentation for configuration details. Missing this step means some deployments will silently fall back to defaults.

### 5.3 Use It

```go
if s.DogTags.GetFlagAsBool(dogtags.MY_NEW_FEATURE) {
    // feature enabled
}
```

The service handles defaults, so you never need to check errors.

## 6. Testing

Use `NoopProvider` for tests - it always returns errors, forcing the service to use defaults. For testing specific flag values, create a mock provider.

```go
dogtagsService := dogtags.NewDefaultService() // uses NoopProvider
```

## 7. File Locations
