name: Build and Publish Container Image

description: |-
  This composite action builds a container image based on the specified Dockerfile and metadata.
  It can optionally push the built image to a container registry.
  Ensure you have the necessary Docker and QEMU setup steps in your workflow for cross-platform builds.

inputs:
  dockerhub_account:
    required: true
    description: |-
      The DockerHub username or account name used for authentication.
      This account must have permissions to push images to the specified repositories.

      Example: 'organization_name' or 'username'
  dockerhub_token:
    required: true
    description: |-
      The authentication token or password for the DockerHub account.
      Use a personal access token or deploy token for enhanced security.
      This token must have appropriate permissions for pulling and pushing images.
  ghcr_account:
    required: true
    description: |-
      The GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) username or account name.
      Usually this is your GitHub username or organization name.
      Must have permissions to push containers to the specified GHCR repositories.

      Example: 'github_username' or 'organization_name'
  ghcr_token:
    required: true
    description: |-
      The GitHub personal access token (PAT) for authenticating with GitHub Container Registry.
      Token must have the necessary permissions:
      - read:packages
      - write:packages
      - delete:packages (if image overwriting is needed)
  build_platforms:
    required: true
    default: "linux/amd64,linux/arm64"
    description: |-
      Comma-separated list of target platforms for the container build.
      Specifies the CPU architectures and operating systems for which
      the container image should be built.

      Examples:
      - "linux/amd64" for x86_64 Linux only
      - "linux/amd64,linux/arm64" for both x86_64 and ARM64 Linux
      - "linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7" for additional ARM support
  image_labels:
    required: true
    default: "false"
    description: |-
      A JSON object containing image labels and metadata.
      These labels help describe the image and can include information like
      version, author, and licenses.
  image_tags:
    required: true
    default: "false"
    description: |-
      A comma-separated list of tags to assign to the built image.
      These tags help identify different versions or variants of the image.
  image_provenance:
    required: true
    default: "false"
    description: |-
      Whether to include image provenance information in the image metadata.
      Provenance information provides details about how the image was built and can be useful for auditing.
  image_sbom:
    required: true
    default: "false"
    description: |-
      Whether to include a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the image metadata.
      An SBOM lists all the software components used in the image, enhancing transparency and security.
  dockerfile:
    default: Dockerfile
    description: |-
      The name of the Dockerfile used for building the container image.
      If not specified, it defaults to 'Dockerfile' in the repository root.

      Example: 'Dockerfile.prod' for a production-specific Dockerfile.
  build_context:
    default: "{{defaultContext}}"
    description: |-
      Build's context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL (default Git context)
  build_target:
    description: |-
      The build stage target for multi-stage Docker builds, if applicable.
      Specify this if your Dockerfile has multiple stages, and you want to build a specific one.

      Example: 'production' for a multi-stage Dockerfile with a 'production' stage.
  build_args:
    description: |-
      Additional build arguments to pass to the Docker build process.
      These arguments can be used to customize the build based on your requirements.

      Example: 'MY_VARIABLE=value' to set an environment variable during the build.
  build_contexts:
    description: |-
      Additional build contexts to pass to Docker build process.

      Define additional build context with specified contents. In Dockerfile the
      context can be accessed when FROM name or --from=name is used. When
      Dockerfile defines a stage with the same name it is overwritten.

      Example: 'name=path'
  build_outputs:
    required: true
    description: |-
      Set build outputs.
  cache_from:
    description: |-
      The source image repository from which to cache layers during the build.
      This can help improve build speed by reusing layers from a previously built image.

      Default: type=gha

      Example: 'docker.io/my-app:cache' to cache from a specific image.
    default: |-
      type=gha
  cache_to:
    description: |-
      The destination image cache settings to optimize the caching strategy during the build.
      This input specifies where to store cached layers and how they are scoped.

      Default: type=gha,mode=max

      Example: "type=gha,mode=max,scope=\$\{\{ github.workflow \}\}"
    default: |-
      type=gha,mode=max
