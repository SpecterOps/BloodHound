name: Generate Container Image Metadata

description: |-
  This composite action generates metadata for a container image and extracts useful information,
  such as JSON data, tags, labels, revision, version, and the container image reference.
  The metadata is essential for tracking and managing container images effectively.

inputs:
  container_image_repository_name:
    required: true
    description: |-
      TBD ...

  image_flavor:
    description: |-
      See: https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#flavor-input

  image_tags:
    description: |-
      See: https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#tags-input

outputs:
  json:
    value: ${{ steps.generate-metadata.outputs.json }}
    description: |-
      The JSON metadata for the container image, including details about the image and its layers.

  tags:
    value: ${{ steps.generate-metadata.outputs.tags }}
    description: |-
      A list of tags associated with the container image, which may include version and branch information.

  labels:
    value: ${{ steps.generate-metadata.outputs.labels }}
    description: |-
      Custom labels associated with the container image, providing additional information and metadata.

  revision:
    value: ${{ fromJSON(steps.generate-metadata.outputs.json).labels['org.opencontainers.image.revision'] }}
    description: |-
      The revision of the container image, if available, typically extracted from metadata labels.

  version:
    value: ${{ steps.generate-metadata.outputs.version }}
    description: |-
      The version of the container image, often derived from tags or other versioning patterns.

  image_reference:
    value: ${{ steps.set-image-reference.outputs.image_reference }}
    description: |-
      The full image reference, including registry, repository, and tag.
      This fully qualified name is used to pull or locate a specific image
      from a particular registry (e.g., docker.io/myrepo/myimage:tag).

  image_name:
    value: ${{ steps.set-image-reference.outputs.image_name }}
    description: |-
      The image name with repository and tag, typically used locally or
      with the default registry. This shorthand version omits the registry
      and assumes the default registry if unspecified (e.g., myimage:tag).
