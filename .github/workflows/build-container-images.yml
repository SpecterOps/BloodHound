        description: |-
          Controls whether to automatically push the built container image to the registry.
          Enable this when you want to:
          - Automatically deploy images in CI/CD pipelines
          - Make images immediately available for testing/staging
          - Ensure consistent image availability across environments

          Set to false when:
          - Running local or development builds
          - Performing security scans before publishing
          - Testing build configurations without deployment

          Example: 'true' to push the image to the registry, 'false' to skip pushing.
      image_flavors:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Defines variations of the same image for different use cases or environments.
          Use image flavors to:
          - Create specialized builds (e.g., alpine, slim, full)
          - Target different architectures or platforms
          - Support multiple runtime configurations
          - Maintain backwards compatibility with legacy systems
