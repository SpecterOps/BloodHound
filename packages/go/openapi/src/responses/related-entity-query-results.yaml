  **OK**

  This endpoint returns a response, dependent upon which return type is requested by the `type` parameter.
  The only supported `type` parameter is `list`.
  While `list` is the only supported `type` parameter, the `graph` parameter can be used
  and will result in a different response structure then documented here.
  For those interested in using the undocumented graph type parameter, the response type is described in the schema
  `model.bh-graph.graph`.
