# About DoodleUi

**DoodleUi** is the component library implementing the SpecterOps design system defined by our designer. We created DoodleUi to solve unique problems found in our organization that are not found in off the shelf solutions.
Our mission is to create a unified design system that empowers teams to build consistent, accessible, and efficient design patterns that reduce development time and ensure brand alignment.
By providing a shared language of components, patterns, and guidelines, we enable our designers and developers to collaborate seamlessly and focus on innovation.

<br />

## Goals

-   **Consistency**: Create predictable, reusable components that align with our visual language.
-   **Efficiency**: Reduce the time teams spend on styling and re-inventing UI patterns.
-   **Simplicity**: Components lean towards doing a few things simply rather than trying to solve all cases.
-   **Accessibility**: Ensure components meet accessibility standards (WCAG) out of the box.
-   **Privacy & Security**: Support secure defaults and safeguard user data by design.

<br />

## What's Inside

-   **Components**: Buttons, checkboxes, inputs, tables, and more.
-   **Tokens (coming soon)**: Color palettes, typography, and spacing guidelines.
-   **Patterns (coming soon)**: Recommended approaches for layouts, forms, and interactions.
-   **Documentation (coming soon)**: Usage guidelines, best practices, and code examples.

<br />

## Development Philosophy

Since we donâ€™t have the same level of dedicated resources as larger component
libraries, we rely on a few guiding principles to maximize impact and minimize
wasted effort.

> Don't reinvent the wheel

Doodle UI components are generated with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), either
by copying code from their site or using the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli),
rather than building from scratch.

## Benefits

-   Faster development with pre-built, themeable components.
-   Fewer bugs and inconsistencies across apps.
-   Clear guidance for designers and developers alike.
-   Scalable foundation that evolves with product needs.
-   Cohesion amongst elements representing our brand expression.
