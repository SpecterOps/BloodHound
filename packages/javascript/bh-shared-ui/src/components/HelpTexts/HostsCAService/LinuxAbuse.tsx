            An attacker may perform several attacks that rely on this relationship. This relationship alone is not
            enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals. The enterprise CA must chain up to a root CA of
            the AD forest and it must be trusted for NT authentication in the AD forest for an escalation to be
            possible. If both conditions are met, BloodHound will generate a GoldenCert edge from the computer node to
            the domain node. Check if there is an outbound GoldenCert edge from the computer node.
