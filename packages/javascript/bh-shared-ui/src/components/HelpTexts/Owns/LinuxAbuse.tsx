                        This can be exploited to make said child objects execute arbitrary commands through an immediate

                        The simplest and most straight forward way to abuse control of the OU is to apply a GenericAll

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        It is important to note that the compromise vector described above relies on ACL inheritance and
                        will not work for objects with ACL inheritance disabled, such as objects protected by
                        AdminSDHolder (attribute adminCount=1). This observation applies to any OU child user or
                        computer with ACL inheritance disabled, including objects located in nested sub-OUs.

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        In such a situation, it may still be possible to exploit GenericAll permissions on an OU through
                        an alternative attack vector. Indeed, with GenericAll permissions over an OU, you may make
                        modifications to the gPLink attribute of the OU. The ability to alter the gPLink attribute of an
                        OU may allow an attacker to apply a malicious Group Policy Object (GPO) to all of the OU's child
                        user and computer objects (including the ones located in nested sub-OUs). This can be exploited
                        to make said child objects execute arbitrary commands through an immediate scheduled task, thus
                        compromising them.

                        machine may be used to perform the attack. Note that the attack vector implementation is not
                        trivial and will require some setup.
