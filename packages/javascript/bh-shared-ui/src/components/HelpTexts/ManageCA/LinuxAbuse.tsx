                CA administrators can perform the following actions that may enable an ADCS escalation:
                <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'decimal', paddingLeft: '1.5em' }}>
                    <li>Grant CA officer (ManageCertificates) on enterprise CA</li>
                    <li>Publish certificate templates</li>
                    <li>Grant enroll on enterprise CA</li>
                    <li>Enable configurations like the ESC6 flag (EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2)</li>
                </ol>
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body2'>
                An attacker can identify an ADCS escalation where one or more requirements are not met and enable the
                abuse by performing one or more of the actions above.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body2'>
                The combination of the ManageCA and ManageCertificates permissions allow the attacker to approve
                certificate requests that were denied because lack of enrollment rights on the certificate template or
                on the enterprise CA. A common action is therefore to grant this permission, enroll in an ESC1 template
                that the attacker does not have enrollment rights on, issue the certificate of the denied request. This
                attack fails if role separation is enabled on the CA, as it enforces that users cannot have both ManageCA
                and ManageCertificates. However, this setting is very rare.
