            An attacker who is a member of "Authenticated Users" triggers a webclient based coercion from the target
            computer to their attacker host. Since the connection originates from the webclient instead of SMB, the
            attacker can relay the inbound auth attempt to LDAP(S) if the LDAP(S) signing/EPA settings allow it. The
            relay to LDAP(S) is used to abuse RBCD or Shadow Credentials against the victim computer account.
