                        The AllExtendedRights permission grants {sourceName} the ability to change the password of the
                        user {targetName} without knowing their current password. This is equivalent to the
                        "ForceChangePassword" edge in BloodHound.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        There are at least two ways to execute this attack. The first and most obvious is by using the
                        built-in net.exe binary in Windows (e.g.: net user dfm.a Password123! /domain). See the opsec
                        considerations tab for why this may be a bad idea. The second, and highly recommended method, is
                        by using the Set-DomainUserPassword function in PowerView. This function is superior to using
                        the net.exe binary in several ways. For instance, you can supply alternate credentials, instead
                        of needing to run a process as or logon as the user with the ForceChangePassword permission.
                        Additionally, you have much safer execution options than you do with spawning net.exe (see the
                        opsec tab).
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        To abuse this permission with PowerView's Set-DomainUserPassword, first import PowerView into
                        your agent session or into a PowerShell instance at the console. You may need to authenticate to
                        the Domain Controller as{' '}
                        {sourceType === 'User'
                            ? `${sourceName} if you are not running a process as that user`
                            : `a member of ${sourceName} if you are not running a process as a member`}
                        . To do this in conjunction with Set-DomainUserPassword, first create a PSCredential object
                        (these examples comes from the PowerView help documentation):

                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        Then create a secure string object for the password you want to set on the target user:

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        Finally, use Set-DomainUserPassword, optionally specifying $Cred if you are not already running
                        a process as {sourceName}:

                    <Typography variant='body2'>
                        Now that you know the target user's plain text password, you can either start a new agent as
                        that user, or use that user's credentials in conjunction with PowerView's ACL abuse functions,
                        or perhaps even RDP to a system the target user has access to. For more ideas and information,
                        see the references tab.
