                happen. If the user you are abusing is the same user as the one logged on, you will effectively take
                over their session and kick the logged on user off, resulting in a message to the user. If the users are
                different, you will be prompted to kick the currently logged on user off the system and log on. If the
                target computer is a server, you will be able to initiate the connection without issue provided the user
                you are abusing is not currently logged in.
