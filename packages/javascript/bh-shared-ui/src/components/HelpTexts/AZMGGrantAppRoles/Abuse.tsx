                With the ability to grant arbitrary app roles, you can grant the RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory app
                role to a Service Principal you already control, and then promote it or another principal to Global
                Administrator.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                These functions require you to supply an MS Graph-scoped JWT associated with the Service Principal that
                has the privilege to grant app roles. There are several ways to acquire a JWT. For example, you may use
                BARKâ€™s Get-MSGraphTokenWithClientCredentials to acquire an MS Graph-scoped JWT by supplying a Service
                Principal Client ID and secret:
            </Typography>

            <Typography component={'pre'}>
                {`$MGToken = Get-MSGraphTokenWithClientCredentials \`
    -ClientID "34c7f844-b6d7-47f3-b1b8-720e0ecba49c" \`
    -ClientSecret "asdf..." \`
    -TenantName "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"`}
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                Use BARK's Get-AllAzureADServicePrincipals to collect all Service Principal objects in the tenant:
            </Typography>

            <Typography component={'pre'}>
                {`"$SPs = Get-AllAzureADServicePrincipals \`
    -Token $MGToken"`}
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                Next, find the MS Graph Service Principal's ID. You can do this by piping $SPs to Where-Object, finding
                objects where the appId value matches the universal ID for the MS Graph Service Principal, which is
                00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000:
            </Typography>

            <Typography component={'pre'}>
                {'$SPs | ?{$_.appId -Like "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"} | Select id'}
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                The output will be the object ID of the MS Graph Service Principal. Take that ID and use it as the
                "ResourceID" argument for BARK's New-AppRoleAssignment function. The AppRoleID of
                '9e3f62cf-ca93-4989-b6ce-bf83c28f9fe8' is the universal ID for RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory. The
                SPObjectId is the object ID of the Service Principal you want to grant this app role to:
            </Typography>

            <Typography component={'pre'}>
                {`'New-AppRoleAssignment \`
    -SPObjectId "6b6f9289-fe92-4930-a331-9575e0a4c1d8" \`
    -AppRoleID "9e3f62cf-ca93-4989-b6ce-bf83c28f9fe8" \`
    -ResourceID "9858020a-4c00-4399-9ae4-e7897a8333fa" \`
    -Token $MGToken'`}
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                If successful, the output of this command will show you the App Role assignment ID. Now that your
                Service Principal has the RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory MS Graph app role, you can promote the
                Service Principal to Global Administrator using BARK's New-AzureADRoleAssignment.
            </Typography>

            <Typography component={'pre'}>
                {`New-AzureADRoleAssignment \`
    -PrincipalID "6b6f9289-fe92-4930-a331-9575e0a4c1d8" \`
    -RoleDefinitionId "62e90394-69f5-4237-9190-012177145e10" \`
    -Token $MGToken`}
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant='body2'>
                If successful, the output will include the principal ID, the role ID, and a unique ID for the role
                assignment.
