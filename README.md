<hr />

BloodHound is a monolithic web application composed of an embedded React frontend with [Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/) and a [Go](https://go.dev/) based REST API backend. It is deployed with a [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) application database and a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database, and is fed by the [SharpHound](https://github.com/SpecterOps/SharpHound) and [AzureHound](https://github.com/SpecterOps/AzureHound) data collectors.

BloodHound leverages graph theory to reveal hidden and often unintended relationships across identity and access management systems. Powered by [OpenGraph](https://specterops.io/opengraph/), BloodHound now supports comprehensive analysis beyond Active Directory and Azure environments, enabling users to map complex privilege relationships across [diverse identity platforms](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/opengraph/library). Attackers can utilize BloodHound to rapidly discover sophisticated attack paths otherwise impossible to identify manually, while defenders can proactively identify and mitigate these risks. Both red and blue teams benefit from BloodHound's expanded capabilities, gaining deeper insights into identity and privilege structures across their entire security landscape.

BloodHound CE is created and maintained by the [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/) team who also brought you [BloodHound Enterprise](https://specterops.io/bloodhound-overview/). The original BloodHound was created by [@\_wald0](https://www.twitter.com/_wald0), [@CptJesus](https://twitter.com/CptJesus), and [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).
